    <p>Right now I&rsquo;m finding this question a tough one to answer. The hardcore geeks out there are probably saying &ldquo;install all the distros you need!&rdquo;, but I&rsquo;m not sure if I want to do that or not. Right now, I&rsquo;m thinking not, and it&rsquo;s going to take a bit of time to convince me that having multiple distros installed is valuable to me.</p>

<p>I do want to have at least one Linux distribution running on my machine at home. I think over time there&rsquo;s a very strong possibility that I will end up with a few, but right now, having more than one will not serve any purpose. So I have to make the decision.</p>

<p>The short-list is <a href="http://www.gentoo.org" title="Gentoo Linux">Gentoo</a> and <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com" title="Ubuntu Linux">Ubuntu</a>. Why? Well, I&rsquo;ve played with Gentoo in the past and I really liked it, partly because it was very similar to buying a bunch of bricks and wood and attempting to build a house. It took a bit to learn and get going, and that was part of the appeal for me as learning new stuff was a key part of the undertaking. While I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ve got stacks more to learn as far as Linux goes, I&rsquo;m not sure if I want to go through the pain of getting it set up again, I&rsquo;d rather have it just work for me without a great deal of effort (yes, you Linux geeks at the back, settle down! :)). There are a few other things I like about Gentoo, including <a href="http://gentoo-portage.com/" title="Gentoo Portage" title="_blank">portage</a> and the way things are compiled using settings that are configured to make the most of <em>your</em> hardware.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I&rsquo;ve heard some really nice things about Ubuntu, and I&rsquo;m yet to play with this distro myself. I&rsquo;ve heard it&rsquo;s much easier to set up, and is a very &ldquo;friendly&rdquo; Linux distro - that is, one that I don&rsquo;t have to fight with too much to get going and get configured to work well for me. One negative thing that I have heard about this is that the 64-bit version isn&rsquo;t quite as &lsquo;solid&rsquo; as it is on Gentoo, but I might be wrong.</p>

<p>There is one side of me that says &ldquo;<em>go with what you know</em>&rdquo; and stick with Gentoo, but the true geek in me says &ldquo;<em>get your hands dirty with something new and see what all the fuss is about</em>&rdquo; and go with Ubuntu. Dan the Man over at <a href="http://www.shiftperception.com" title="Shiftperception">Shifty</a> (and at least <a href="http://www.shiftperception.com/blog/posts/how-to-blow-up-2-computers-in-2-weeksthe-the-ballad-of-the-spare-computer/" title="How to blow up 2 computers in 2 weeks">one of his colleagues</a>) are using Ubuntu, and Dan himself likes it very much. I have a close mate in the USA (greetings Bryce :)) who has been a fan and an advocate of Gentoo for a long time, and his arguments are always hard to ignore (though I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;d be happy to hear of people using any form of Linux over Windoze).</p>

<p>So which is it going to be? I think I might just go the Ubuntu route and see how it treats me. If I feel that it&rsquo;s not enough I may even put the effort into getting Gentoo running alonside it. The ultimate goal would be to have Win32, Win x64, Gentoo <em>and</em> Ubuntu all running at once. Of course this comes with the question: Should I be doing multi-boots? Or should I create Virtual Machines instead?</p>

<p>Tough call. I think I&rsquo;ll answer that in my next post when I respond to <a href="http://www.shiftperception.com/blog/posts/how-to-blow-up-2-computers-in-2-weeksthe-the-ballad-of-the-spare-computer/" title="How to blow up 2 computers in 2 weeks">Dan&rsquo;s blog</a> :)</p>
