    <p>As you all know, I recently moved the Blackapache site to a new server. We had some teething issues, as ya do when making the move, but all is now well. One of the things that I hadn&rsquo;t got round to fixing was my <a href="http://www.spamassassin.org/" title="SpamAssassin">SpamAssassin</a> installation.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d already gone through the fun times of setting up email (POP3s, IMAP4s) with <a href="http://www.qmail.org/" title="Qmail">Qmail</a>, which after a bit of time (and a learning curve) was working fine (with SSL, hence the &rsquo;s&rsquo; at the end of the names ;) ) and all my users were able to send/receive without an issues. While trying to set it up, I was having issues getting both SpamAssassin and <a href="http://www.clamav.net/" title="Clam AV">Clam AntiVirus</a> working. Both of the daemons would run fine, but I just couldn&rsquo;t quite get the configuration right.</p>

<p>Thankfully, AV isn&rsquo;t so much of an issue as my users all have AV protection on their local machines. Spam, while annoying, can be lived with until I find the time to get the filters working properly - so I basically left these two things alone for a while until I found the time after doing all the other <em>urgent</em> bits.</p>

<p>I finally got round to making an attempt to fix the problem a weekend or so ago, but still couldn&rsquo;t get it to behave. I read forum upon forum, blog upon blog, and readme upon readme, but for some reason the bloody thing just refused to work. I got frustrated, reverted all the settings back to how they were before, and gave up for the day.</p>

<p>During the last week I was prepping myself for another attempt at getting it work, when I heard about <a href="http://www.google.com/a/" title="Google Apps">Google Apps</a>. I was a bit surprised when I first read all the details, because it was the first time I&rsquo;d heard about it! Being a geek I thought I was pretty good with keeping up to speed, and I was a bit narked with myself for letting this golden nugget slip through the net.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not going to go through the ins and outs of what Google Apps is all about as there are already a <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&q=google+apps" title="Google Apps Search">stack</a> of pages out there already talking about it. What I will say is that I should have made the move earlier!</p>

<p>Not only do I no longer have to worry about keeping my entire email configuration (Qmail with vpopmail and courier imap, SpamAssassin, ClamAV, Horde/SquirrelMail) up to date and patched, I don&rsquo;t even have to have it running. The &ldquo;precious&rdquo; resources on the server can now be utilised for other things such as an <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" title="SubVersion">SVN</a> install. Each email user has 2GB of space, webmail comes for free and has the fantastic facilities that come with <a href="http://www.gmail.com/" title="Gmail">Gmail</a>. Users can easily configure their own accounts, handle their own password changes, etc. My administration of email has basically dropped to just above zero. The only thing I need to do as an administrator is get the account set up initially, the rest is up to the user.</p>

<p>You can probably tell that I&rsquo;m quite excited about this. It&rsquo;s great that I don&rsquo;t have to worry about this any more, and I can put more time and effort into other things.  Of course, my excitement only extends as far as email for now, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure that over time I&rsquo;ll also come to love the added features of <a href="http://calendar.google.com/" title="Google Calendar">Google Calendar</a> and <a href="http://docs.google.com/" title="Google Calendar">Google Calendar</a>.</p>

<p>This service does come with its limitations, and with the possibility of Google Datamining, but for a home server which I use for a blog, having this facility to lighten the admin load is just fantastic.</p>

<p>I highly recommend considering this as an option if you&rsquo;re looking to sort out an email host! Give it a trial, at least for a while, and you may find you&rsquo;re as happy as I am. If you don&rsquo;t like it, you can always revert back to your old setup.</p>
