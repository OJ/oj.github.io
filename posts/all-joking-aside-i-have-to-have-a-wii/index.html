	<h1> All joking aside, I have to have a Wii </h1>
	  
	  <span class="text-muted">Posted by:&nbsp;Thu Sep 21, 2006</span>

	  <p>I&rsquo;ve been a gamer for a very long time. My interest in games is what launched my programming career, and as a young kid I used to spend hours trying to figure out how those games worked on my Commodore Vic 20. Peeking and Poking was as far as I got in those days, but the interest has been around since. For many years I worked hard to try and get a job in the games industry, and with the industry here in Australia being quite hard to get into I decided to head to the U.K. where there are more developers and a bit more opportunity to get the foot in the door. After contracting for a year to build up some funds (Australian dollars don&rsquo;t do so well against the Pound) I ended up working for a game company in Guildford. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever had so much fun at work, and just between you (the rest of the world) and me, there are quite a few things I miss about that job. I have talked in the past about finding people who are good, and one of the things I failed to mention (because my list was far from exhaustive) was <strong>passion</strong>. While there are people in <em>any</em> industry that lack passion for what they do, you can&rsquo;t help but feel that the greatest concentration of passionate developers lies in the realms of games development.</p>

<p>That little blurb isn&rsquo;t really necessary reading for the purpose of this article, I guess I just wanted to let you know that I have a bit of a background in playing, and building, games. I&rsquo;m sure that many gamers out there will agree with me when I say that it&rsquo;s getting to the point now where there are so few titles being released that really push the boundaries of gameplay. There are a <em>s**tload</em> of games released all the time, most of which suck (either fully or partially). To be honest, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a game on the planet that doesn&rsquo;t suck in <em>some</em> way. The thing is, in my opinion, the amount of suckiness (let&rsquo;s call it <strong>suckage</strong> to keep with the gaming theme) in games is going up and up. Suckage is increasing rapidly, and I&rsquo;ve been finding it hard to get excited about new gaming technology (such as the next-gen consoles) and the games that will be running on them &hellip;</p>

<p>&hellip; until today!</p>

<p>Well that&rsquo;s not 100% true, I have in some ways been excited, but not to the same <em>extent</em> as the excitement I felt today. The reason is because of the shower of gold that is known as the <a href="http://wii.nintendo.com/" title="Nintendo Wii">Nintendo Wii</a>. I have been keeping tabs on the situation surrounding the Wii ever since Nintendo first announced that they were going to be making a next-generation games console, which back then was codenamed the <em>Revolution</em> (which, in my opinion, they should have stuck with - but I&rsquo;m no marketing genius :)). There&rsquo;s been quite a bit of speculation about how good or bad this console is going to be, and lately it has really been under fire - not just because of it&rsquo;s name.</p>

<p>The first thing geeks do when they hear about new hardware is look at the tech specs and compare to either what&rsquo;s on the market already or what the product is going to be competing with. I&rsquo;m not going to list all the specifications of the Wii (or it&rsquo;s competitors) but at first glance it <em>does</em> look like the Wii lacks grunt compared to the consoles it&rsquo;s going to be taking on. So already the naysayers are stating that the console will choke because it just &ldquo;can&rsquo;t keep up&rdquo;. Add on to this the new controller, which is quite out of the ordinary, and you&rsquo;ve got most of the gaming population pointing, laughing and saying that the console will &ldquo;&hellip; suck due its lack of power, pissy name and TV-remote-style controller.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I think they&rsquo;re wrong. <em>Very very</em> wrong. There&rsquo;s something about this console and it&rsquo;s features that I find very compelling. The new remote controller initially seems wierd when you first look at it, but when you take a bit of time to think about how it might work, you come to realise that it&rsquo;s actually quite natural. I think that this style of control is going to unlock an element of fun that the other consoles, with their standard games and standard controllers, will fail to unlock. Let&rsquo;s face it, games aren&rsquo;t about the whizzbang graphics, or about how many rocks there are flying about on screen at once - they&rsquo;re about <em>FUN</em>! Nintendo cottoned on to this notion from the very start. Not one person who has played Nintendo games from the start can say that they&rsquo;ve not had fun <strong>consistently</strong> on most (if not all) Nintendo hardware. These guys have mastered the art of producing technology which allow people to enjoy themselves.</p>

<p>The link that kicked this feeling to the front of my mind was one I stumbled on (and I don&rsquo;t even know how) earlier today - it&rsquo;s called the <a href="http://www.trustedreviews.com/article.aspx?art=3431" title="TrustedReviews - Nintendo Wii Preview">Nintendo Wii Preview</a>. Nine pages of Wii goodness that really need to be checked out. If you don&rsquo;t know what the Wii is, then you should read this and have a look at the official homepage. It&rsquo;s going to be a blast.</p>

<p>In short, I think this console will win the next-generation console wars. It captures an element of fun that the other consoles can&rsquo;t capture. It adds a style of gameplay that the other consoles can&rsquo;t add. It&rsquo;ll make <em>old</em> games replayable purely because of the way you interact with it. It&rsquo;ll get more people involved because you don&rsquo;t have to be a grandmaster with a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; gamepad controller any more, you just need to time you natural movements properly.</p>

<p>I think there are so many possibilities for this console that it&rsquo;s going to last for a <em>very</em> long time. I think there might even be a chance for me to get Amy playing some games in front of the TV with me, which would be great fun - especially when we&rsquo;re throwing ourselves around the room because of the nature of the controls.</p>

<p>Come on Wii! I may have laughed at you in the early days, but I&rsquo;ll take your low specs and fun games over the shiny, spaceship-style Xbox360/PS3 with great looking but poor gaming titles any day.</p>

<p>Thank you Nintendo. You&rsquo;ve given an old gamer a glimmer of hope that the next generation of console gaming has the chance of being enjoyable, and not just packed with suckage!</p>
