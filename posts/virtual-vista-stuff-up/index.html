    <p>OK, so it looks like I might have been misinformed (er&hellip; wrong :)) by stating that the basic versions of Vista can&rsquo;t be installed on VMs. That&rsquo;ll teach me not to read the licencing details properly myself! It looks like it was a slight misunderstanding of the terms and structure that MS used in stating the rules. I won&rsquo;t go into the details myself since <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/Bott/?p=157" title="No, theres no ban on virtual Vista">Ed Bott has already done it for me</a>. So, MS <em>haven&rsquo;t</em> shot themselves in the foot in this regard, but they still seem to be doing it in other ways.</p>

<p>One of those ways, which is now 100% confirmed, is that you can only move your installation of Vista to a different machine (read: different hardware) <strong>once and once <em>only</em></strong>. Again, this is confirmed courtesty of <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/Bott/?p=156" title="A sneaky change in Windows licensing terms">Ed Bott</a>. Instead of being able to reinstall when you buy a new mobo, and then reinstall again after you buy a new CPU, you may well have to fork out for another Vista licence due to the hardware change. What a lovely feature!</p>

<p>Yesterday&rsquo;s chat (via previous post on Vista) with Bryce got me thinking about what other peoples&rsquo; thoughts were regarding the whole stance MS are taking with Vista, and during my searches I found <a href="http://www.computerpoweruser.com/editorial/article.asp?article=articles/archive/c0611/44c11/44c11.asp&guid=8CF5E5CB35CB42E1857F6F42970E2A2C" title="Vista Will Double Apples Market Share">this post by Chris Pirillo</a> (a long-time MS user) which covers his views on said topic. It&rsquo;s quite an interesting read :) He also took a bit of time to post on his blog after writing the article to cover some <a href="http://chris.pirillo.com/posts/microsoft-windows-vista-vs-apple-os-x/" title="Microsoft Windows Vista vs. Apple OS X">other points</a>, again well worth reading.  It&rsquo;s good to see another long-term MS user with the balls to speak out loud and say that Macs are becoming more appealing by the day.  I agree with him when he says that MS isn&rsquo;t really making this a difficult decision to make.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never been a huge fan of Macs, partly because I never had to use them and Windows was familiar, but as time goes by I&rsquo;m rethinking my position. I keep saying that there&rsquo;s not enough software out there for me to make the move to Mac (and Linux), but not I&rsquo;m thinking that I need to make the switch and become one of the developers that can help sort that problem out :D</p>

<p>So, sorry about my stuff up, but it doesn&rsquo;t really improve my view of Vista by much anyway!</p>
