    <p>When I first signed up for <a href="http://www.twitter.com/" title="Twitter">Twitter</a> back in mid-2008 I didn&rsquo;t really take it seriously. My view was that it was a toy and one that I intended to have a bit of fun with. I didn&rsquo;t really think that it would turn into what it did. I certainly didn&rsquo;t think it would be such an amazing source of information, nor did I expect it to give me contact with so many smart and interesting people.</p>

<p>The idea of investing so much time in a stream of text-bites that are no more than 140 characters long seems a bit absurd. That&rsquo;s certainly what I felt when I first signed up. How could a meaningful discussion be had? Why is it any better than the likes of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat" title="IRC">IRC</a>? Why would I use it for anything than fire-and-forget with a goal of having a laugh?</p>

<p>When I first started, I felt like I was just doing a Facebook-style status update. I can guarantee that my first Tweets were uninteresting noise; the kind you can find in most people&rsquo;s Twitter feeds even now. I did make a point of avoiding the kind of updates that <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2008/4/23/" title="Twitter Shitter">Penny Arcade</a> were having fun with at the time.</p>

<p>After an initial flurry where I played with the site and a few different clients I started to settle down and focus on a few topics that I was interested in. After following those topics for a while I slowly but surely found networks of people &ndash; <em>smart</em> people &ndash; who posted really interesting content. The content would often come in the form of a link with a tiny opinion alongside it which added to my ability to filter out the stuff I would and wouldn&rsquo;t want to read.</p>

<p>It didn&rsquo;t take long for Twitter to start making my RSS subscriptions a little cumbersome. The links and news were so fresh that the idea of using something that didn&rsquo;t feel as &ldquo;soft real-time&rdquo; seemed like a waste of time. I felt that I had somehow landed on a more reliable source of information that was being filtered by people that I respected.</p>

<p>Being a sometimes vocal person in the technology world I thought I&rsquo;d best do my bit to contribute to this new form of information sharing. While I kept up the fun side of using Twitter I put more time and effort into sharing the content I had found, passing on other people&rsquo;s Tweets, adding my own short summation of the information being shared.</p>

<p>It took about 6 months for me to really realise the power that Twitter was giving me. I had, on many occasions, managed to get access to very influential people who work in or on the technology platforms that I was working with. I received personalised help, if not directly on Twitter then via email after a brief Twitter conversation. I was able to reach <em>many</em> people, varying from beginners through to experts, who were actively engaged in learning about languages and technologies, and having contact with those people helped me learn even more about what I was working with.</p>

<p>Twitter was a gold mine of information, and not just technical.</p>

<p>So is Twitter a muck-around tool? Perhaps for some is it, but for me it is way more. Should you use it? I think so, particularly if you&rsquo;re a geek.</p>

<p>If you do decide to get stuck in and sign up for Twitter, or if you&rsquo;ve got an account already but don&rsquo;t feel you&rsquo;re getting the most out of it, here are a few things that I highly recommend you do:</p>

<ol>
<li>Fill out your bio and add a link to a meaningful website.</li>
<li>Make use of the <a href="http://www.searchenginejournal.com/twitter-hashtags/9419/" title="What is a hashtag?">hashtag searches</a>. This facility will make it really easy for you to connect with people who are interested in the same topics as you.</li>
<li>Use hashtags yourself in you Tweets to make them visible to that same group of people.</li>
<li>Listen in on other people&rsquo;s conversations. Browse through the threads as they&rsquo;re often littered with interesting an valuable information.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t but into discussions or make noise unless you really do have something valuable to say. In other words, add signal and not noise (yes, I should practise what I&rsquo;m preaching here).</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t be scared to be yourself, you&rsquo;ll find that it&rsquo;ll be easier for others to garner respect for you.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t be afraid to have an opinion and be honest.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t worry about offending or being offended.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t feel obliged to follow people back just because they&rsquo;ve followed you, and vice versa. Twitter isn&rsquo;t Facebook or Linked In.</li>
<li>Make sure you spend time once a week going through your followers and removing any spammers. When people first discover you on Twitter they&rsquo;ll look at your bio, your site and your followers. The last thing you want others to think is that you&rsquo;re a spammer yourself, or are closely associated with spammers.</li>
</ol>

<p>Oh, and enjoy yourself! Have fun with it. You&rsquo;ll learn way more and engage more people if you do.</p>

<p>You can <a href="http://twitter.com/TheColonial" title="OJ on Twitter">add me too</a> if you like (no pressure).</p>
