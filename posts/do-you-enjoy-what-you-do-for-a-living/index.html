	<h1> Do you Enjoy what you do for a Living? </h1>
	  
	  <span class="text-muted">Posted by:&nbsp;Mon Mar 12, 2007</span>

	  <p>I remember when I was in high school as a teenager and all I wanted to &lsquo;be&rsquo; was a Software Engineer.  I was one of those lucky people who always seemed to know what it is they wanted to do, and for me it was always going to be creating software.  I got stuck into a plethora of coding projects in my own time while finishing school which, along with doing &ldquo;Computer Studies&rdquo; for the last 3 years, gave me a pretty solid grounding to build on when I got to University.</p>

<p>When I finally started my study of Computer Science at Uni I found many of the subjects very easy - particularly the programming ones.  In fact, they become boring very quickly due to the fact that it felt like I was just learning new syntax.  Syntax is always the easy/boring bit, it&rsquo;s the understanding of the programming constructs that&rsquo;s the key&hellip; but I digress.</p>

<p>So to keep myself interested, I decided to pick a couple of topics that I&rsquo;d always been interested in.  Yes, they&rsquo;re very cliched, but the topics I chose were:<ul><li>Software Security &amp; Reverse Engineering</li><li>Computer Graphics &amp; Game Programming</li></ul>Both of these fields had always been fascinating to me, so I decided to take some of the time that I had set aside for study and pump it into these two topics.</p>

<p>An uber-geek was born.</p>

<p>As I progressed through my study I was fortunate enough to land myself a full-time job in a software development company.  I started off working in the testing area, and quickly moved into development.  The application I worked on was an accounting and practice management system, and I was using C++ and VB on a daily basis.  I thought I&rsquo;d found utopia!  I was finally in a paid programming job, what else could there possibly be in life?</p>

<p>Unfortunately it wasn&rsquo;t utopia.  After a fairly short period of time, I found myself becoming disinterested in what I was doing.  Accountancy wasn&rsquo;t interesting, the application wasn&rsquo;t interesting, the workplace wasn&rsquo;t interesting, there was no life in the developers around me - it was a completely stagnant place to be.</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until that point that I realised that just being a programmer wasn&rsquo;t enough.  I had always thought that I&rsquo;d be happy writing code of any kind, so long as I was writing code.  But I was completely wrong.  If you don&rsquo;t work in a field that you find interesting it becomes extremely hard to remain focussed or even become mildly excited about going to work.  If you don&rsquo;t feel excited or interested in what you do, then you&rsquo;re bound to end up unhappy.  The bane of full-time work is that it takes up so much of your life that it&rsquo;s very hard not to be affected by it.  So if you want to be happy, it&rsquo;s a good idea to find work that you like!</p>

<p>As I&rsquo;ve already mentioned I love working with graphics, gaming, security and reverse engineering (no doubt you&rsquo;ve gathered that from some of the recent posts!).  Unfortunately these fields are all very difficult to get involved in professionally and they require a <strong>lot</strong> of ground work.  When I decided to chase one of these two fields professionally, I chose the graphics and gaming option because of the satisfaction of seeing things come alive.  I won&rsquo;t go into all the reasons for me being passionate about this line of work as it&rsquo;s worthy of it&rsquo;s own post.  Suffice is to say that it was appealing enough for me to alter the course of my career to chase it.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s part of the reason I did my stint in the UK.  Getting into the games industry here in Australia proved to be a real bitch.  It is still quite tight, and unless you have contacts in the industry or some experience from elsewhere, your chances of getting a foot in the door are pretty slim.  In the end, the travel, the bad weather, the awful pay cut and the 2 years away from my home land were worth it.  I worked in games with some fantastic people and it was an amazing experience.</p>

<p>Life is too short to be working in a field which you don&rsquo;t enjoy.  So if you&rsquo;re not happy, do something about it!</p>

<p>And finally we come to the point(s) of the post.  Do you like what you do?  Have you found a job that you find interesting, and is it something that you <em>can</em> get excited about?  Do you struggle to get up in the morning and motivate yourself to charge into the day ahead because you&rsquo;re not that keen to get to work?</p>

<p>For those of you who are geeks, what areas of the computer world do you find interesting?  Are you working as an I.T. professional but hate it?</p>
