    <p>Some of you might not know about <a href="http://www.thewiggles.com.au/" title="The Wiggles">The Wiggles</a>, but those of you who are either Australian or have any connection with an extremely young family member will probably have a fair idea. In short, they&rsquo;re a collection of dudes who do performances for kiddies, and have managed to make themselves a fortune putting smiles on the dials of kids all over the world. Hats off to them!</p>

<p>The question I&rsquo;m asking isn&rsquo;t serious ;) But I have to ask it because I think that one of their famous songs has been written with my current software development project in mind! The song I&rsquo;m referring to is called Hot Potato. For a fab rendition, check out <a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/FV6nJxg7mM0" title="YouTube Video: The Wiggles">this YooooooouTube vid</a>. Feel free to play it a few times and get used to the dance moves :)</p>

<p>So, why do I think that these guys might have based the song on software dev? Well I think it&rsquo;s very simple:
<ul><li><strong>Hot potato</strong>: This refers to the job or task that noone wants to get done. It&rsquo;s the feature that the client <em>really</em> wants that noone&rsquo;s prepared to put the time into implementing. It could also mean a subsection of the system that was originally written to adhere to the &ldquo;cold spaghetti&rdquo; architecture, which has resulted in code that&rsquo;s so hard to maintain the nobody wants to touch it.</li><li><strong>Cold Spaghetti</strong>: AKA &ldquo;code spaghetti&rdquo;. This is the overall architecture of the software system. It indicates the level of thought that was put into it, and gives a great visualisation of what the resulting code looks like. The beauty of the word &ldquo;cold&rdquo; in this scenario is that it adds a new dimension to the well known &ldquo;spaghetti code&rdquo; theory. As we all know, cold spaghetti <em>sticks together</em> in one nasty congealed clump of starchy mess, and dissecting it is a nightmare! Soooooo true in the case of spaghetti code.</li><li><strong>Mash Banana</strong>: Currently very regular in the project I&rsquo;m working on! This is all those fabulous ideas that could possibly <em>improve</em> the quality of the system - but team members don&rsquo;t like the tall poppies so those ideas are mashed to a pulp so that they never see the light of day and hence don&rsquo;t make the rest of the team feel insecure due to them not thinking of the idea themselves.</li></ul></p>

<p>See, it all makes sense!</p>

<p>&hellip; or am I barking mad?</p>
