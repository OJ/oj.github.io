	<h1> Lacking Focus? Give DarkRoom a Spin! </h1>
	  
	  <span class="text-muted">Posted by:&nbsp;Wed May 23, 2007</span>

	  <p>My eternal quest for maximising productivity has recently lead me in the direction of an interesting new application called <a href="http://they.misled.us/dark-room" title="DarkRoom">DarkRoom</a>. Some of you may have heard of this before, and will consider it &lsquo;old news&rsquo;, but I&rsquo;m sure there are some readers out there who wouldn&rsquo;t have heard of it and I feel it&rsquo;s worth pointing out.</p>

<p><a href="/uploads/2007/05/darkroom.png" title="DarkRoom" rel="lightbox"><img src="/uploads/2007/05/darkroom_thumb.png" alt="DarkRoom" class="InlineImageRight" /></a>In short, DarkRoom is designed to do one thing; and that&rsquo;s <strong>minimise distractions</strong>. It&rsquo;s a simple text-editor which takes up your entire screen, covering everything incuding the toolbar and system tray, and leaves you with nothing but a blinking cursor. When you first fire it up you&rsquo;ll find that it closely resembles Keanu Reeves&rsquo; computer screen at the start of <a href="http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/" title="The Matrix">The Matrix</a>, and you might find yourself waiting for the message: <em>Wake up Neo.</em> When you see the colour-scheme you&rsquo;ll know exactly what I mean (check out the screenshot).</p>

<p>If you in any way resemble the Average Joe as far as focus is concerned, anything from a blog post to a design document is tough to write up without being distracted. Those distractions might come in the form of email notifications, chat messages from friends, or a constant need to check what&rsquo;s going on with your RSS feeds. If you&rsquo;re stuck working on something that&rsquo;s really boring, you may even find yourself <em>looking</em> for distractions to help you put it off. Regardless of the type or reason, distractions do nothing for productivity! DarkRoom helps with this by making sure that you can&rsquo;t see them!</p>

<p>When I first read about this little application I wasn&rsquo;t too excited about it. But I <em>am</em> the kind of person that will give little bits of software a go to see how well they perform, and determine whether or not they achieve their goal.</p>

<p>So here I am using DarkRoom for this blog post, and I have to admit that I really do like it. I&rsquo;d usually use <a href="http://www.vim.org/" title="VIM">VIM</a> for writing up my posts, or perhaps even the in-built editor for <a href="http://www.wordpress.org/" title="Wordpress">Wordpress</a>, and so everything else on screen was totally visible, and I was susceptable to all manner of distractions. Since starting this post, I&rsquo;ve not touched the browser, nor my RSS feeds, and I&rsquo;m totally oblivious to any form of attempted contact via email or IM. It really does feel like I&rsquo;m alone in a dark room, and I&rsquo;m left to my own devices.</p>

<p>I like it. I really do like it. The <em>feeling</em> of it is really good, and it&rsquo;s actually a bit of a relief to be away from the &lsquo;busy-ness&rsquo; that is my normal desktop. However, there is something that I&rsquo;d like to change. Being the geek that I am I&rsquo;d love to use this for writing more than just blog posts, or anything that comes in raw text. It&rsquo;d be nice to have syntax highlighting, and it&rsquo;d be great to have the power my favourite editor (VIM) while using this application. In short what I&rsquo;m saying is that if I could make VIM lock me away in the same manner that this DarkRoom application has, then I think I&rsquo;d be extremely productive.</p>

<p>I spend a lot of time editing text, and there&rsquo;s no way that this simple application is going to replace VIM for my everday text editor. I will, however, continue to use it for any form of &lsquo;creative&rsquo; (keep your jokes to yourselves) writing that I might like to do. I feel like it gives me a focus that I don&rsquo;t have when I can see everything else. I can easily resist the temptation to procrastinate when I don&rsquo;t have all the notifications popping up in front of my face.</p>

<p>As I come to the conclusion of this post I can honestly recommend that this should be tried out. It&rsquo;s very light on features, but it&rsquo;s ideal for cranking out blog posts or any form of writing which requires a bit more focus. I sounds boring and unnecessary, but until you see it for yourself you won&rsquo;t fully see its potential. Give it a spin and see how you like it.</p>
