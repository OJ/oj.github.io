	<h1> Living in Australia has a Downside </h1>
	  
	  <span class="text-muted">Posted by:&nbsp;Wed Nov 21, 2007</span>

	  <p>This may come as a surprise, but living in Australia <em>can</em> have it downsides :) Right now I can only think of one, and that&rsquo;s (part of) the reason for this post.</p>

<p>We may have constant sunshine, lovely beaches and a lifestyle to die for, but our broadband just <strong>sucks</strong>. That&rsquo;s a fairly sweeping statement, so let me clarify a little more.</p>

<p>Broadband plans in this country are <em>extremely</em> poor value. The service that you receive for the amount you pay is substandard. It&rsquo;s that simple. Those of you in places like the UK, USA and Hong Kong may find it obscure to consider that a country exists where you can&rsquo;t get an unlimited data connection for DSL. You may also find it difficult to believe that some connection speeds are cut to that of a dial-up connection if you download too much. But that&rsquo;s exactly what happens here.</p>

<p>These days in Australia most ISPs provide a limited download quota per month for a set fee. What happens when you download too much will vary from provider to provider. Many of the providers simply cut your download speed so that it feels like you&rsquo;re back on a dialup modem. Others simply charge per MB or GB that you go over (and they&rsquo;re not cheap either!). What&rsquo;s &ldquo;nice&rdquo; about the latter option is that many of these ISPs don&rsquo;t actually let you know that you&rsquo;ve gone over quota. So instead of being warned, you just cop a huge bill at the end of the month. Yes, I believe it&rsquo;s your job to monitor your bandwidth usage, but that&rsquo;s still pretty shoddy.</p>

<p>Every 6 months or so I have another look around to see if I can find another provider that will offer me more than what I currently have. Right now I have a connection through <a href="http://www.internode.on.net/" title="Internode">Internode</a>. They provide me with an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADSL" title="ADSL">ADSL</a> connection at 1.5mbps/256kbps with 10GB download per month. If I go over that my speed is &ldquo;shaped&rdquo; to 64kbps/64kbps. All of this is delivered down my copper wire for the princly sum of AUD $54.95 per month. No, that doesn&rsquo;t include the cost of having a phone line in the first place.</p>

<p>In day to day life for me this is actually adequate. I don&rsquo;t download too much stuff, and most of my browsing (and the wife&rsquo;s) is fairly light on the bandwidth. But every now and then I feel the pinch and the frustration that comes with my plan&hellip;  <ul><li><strong>Windows Updates.</strong> I&rsquo;m sure that every user of Windows is aware of the joys of constant updates from Microsoft. Some of them are small, some of them are absolutley <em>massive</em>. Multiply these updates by the number of computers in your home, and you&rsquo;ve got quite a hit on the quota.</li><li><strong>Linux Updates.</strong> I just happend to dual-boot Windows XP x64 with <a href="http://www.linuxmint.com/" title="Linux Mint">Linux Mint</a>, and so I have the added benefit of constant updates through that as well. Thankfully I can pick and choose what I want updated, and most of the time the updates are reasonably small (<em>and</em> they don&rsquo;t force me to reboot my machine).</li><li><strong>Steam.</strong> I have a <a href="http://www.steampowered.com/" title="Steam">Steam</a> account which I use to buy pretty much all the games that I play (which aren&rsquo;t many). Most games these days are also bloody massive. Get yourself a copy of Bioshock and Half-Life 2, and you&rsquo;ve nearly blown your monthly quota away. Add to that the updates to the Steam platform, and some of the media/demos you can get for free, and your quota begins to look pitiful.</li><li><strong>Development.</strong> Yes, I&rsquo;m a Geek. I write code. I need tools. I need to keep up to speed. I have a subscription to things like <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/msdn/" title="MSDN">MSDN</a> so I can get access to this stuff. Everything that I need has to be <em>downloaded</em> and hence is yet another huge hit on the download quota.</li></ul>There&rsquo;s obviously some motivation for this post, and strangley enough it&rsquo;s due to the bandwidth issue <em>and</em> MSDN.</p>

<p>Those of you who are reading this are probably geeks too. So you&rsquo;ll know that recently Microsoft decided to release <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/products/aa700831.aspx" title="Visual Studio 2008">Visual Studio 2008</a> which comes with all the creamy goodness of .NET 3.5 and C# 3.0. Not only was I interested in getting this because I wanted to play with it, but I <em>needed</em> it for work. So a download was required (all 3.31GB of it).</p>

<p>Initially I thought I&rsquo;d download the disc image while I was at work. I started the download off yesterday morning when I got into the office only to find &hellip; work suffers from download quotas issues just like the rest of us! It appeared that our bandwidth quota had been blown, and the download speed was being shaped (ie. I was getting a massive 1.2Kb/s off microsoft.com, not good for a 3.31GB download).</p>

<p>Fair enough, I know what that&rsquo;s all about. So I decided to wait til I get home and fire the download off on my home machine over night. When I got home I jumped on MSDN, fired up the download and away it went at 160Kb/s! SWEET! Shame we&rsquo;re stuck using the stupid MSDN downloader application, but hey, it appears to support resuming of downloads so if anything goes wrong I can simply kick it off again and it&rsquo;ll resume from where it left off.</p>

<p>I think you can see where this is going. Before I say any more I&rsquo;d like to ask a key question: Why is it that all downloads die at 99%?</p>

<p>I got up this morning and quickly checked to see if the download had finished. To my dismay, it had reached 99% and then thrown up an error message. I don&rsquo;t have the exact wording handy, but it essentially said:<blockquote><p>The download died for some unknown reason. Give it another go.</p></blockquote>So I hit the resume button with a huge grin, thinking that it was just going to carry on nicely, only to find that MS had slapped me in the face&hellip;<blockquote><p>The file no longer exists on the server. I can&rsquo;t resume. Press X to delete everything you&rsquo;ve downloaded so far, Press Y otherwise.</p></blockquote>I pounced on Y and was grateful to find that the majority of the download was still on disk. I thought I&rsquo;d go back to MSDN downloads to kick the download off again from the start, and try some geek trickery to get it to think that the imgae I&rsquo;d already downloaded was the one I had just started. When I return to MSDN, I find that the link for Visual Studio 2008 Professional constantly redirects back to another page. I wasn&rsquo;t able to get to the same download page to start the download off again and grab that last 1%. Just when I thought it couldn&rsquo;t get any worse&hellip;</p>

<p>&hellip; the downloader closed. Without me asking it to. And with it, it took all 99% of that 3.31GB that I had downloaded.</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t tell you exactly what I said, but I can tell you it wasn&rsquo;t pretty. Various expletives flew around the room, generally in the direction of MS and their stupid downloader. Then I realised that I&rsquo;d blown well over 3GB of my 10GB download per month and achieved absolutely nothing. It was at this poin I hurled abuse at Internode for having such a shitty selection of plans.</p>

<p>After calming down I realised that it wasn&rsquo;t so bad. It could be worse.</p>

<p>&hellip; I could be living in the UK! :D</p>
