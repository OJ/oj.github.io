    <p>As the weeks roll by I&rsquo;m finding that I have less and less time to chase up anything geek-related. I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m not alone ;) Responsibilities and life take over and that time which you <em>could</em> invest is now invested in other things, such as <a href="/posts/my-boy/" title="My Boy">children</a> :)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m dedicating this post to all those things that I currently find interesting and would love to invest time in. Some of these things are old, some new. All of them I&rsquo;ve either not touched on at all, or have touched on only briefly (not enough to be satisfied). I thought I&rsquo;d share them with you in case you find them interesting yourself, or perhaps have some insights which you&rsquo;d like to share.</p>

<p><h2>Haskell</h2>
<a href="http://www.haskell.org/" title="Haskell">Haskell</a> is a fairly well-known functional programming language that&rsquo;s been around for quite some time. It&rsquo;s extremely powerful, and it is a lot of fun to work with. I&rsquo;m certainly no expert in Haskell-land, but so far I&rsquo;ve been able to do some fairly nifty stuff. I&rsquo;ve been ploughing through the <a href="http://projecteuler.net/" title="Project Euler">Project Euler</a> challenges using Haskell and I&rsquo;ve been amazed at how concise the solutions can be. I have a lot more to learn, and I&rsquo;m hoping that I&rsquo;ll get the chance to do just that. If you haven&rsquo;t played with a pure functional language before then give this one a spin. There are a selection of compilers out there, I personally use <a href="http://www.haskell.org/ghc/" title="Glasgow Haskell Compiler">GHC</a>.</p>

<p><h2>F#</h2>
<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/fsharp/fsharp.aspx" title="F#">F#</a> is a relatively new functional language that runs on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework" title=".NET framework">.NET platform</a>. It was created (I believe) by a chap called <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/" title="Don Syme's Weblog">Don Syme</a> and is gaining momentum amongst the geek community. It looks like a lot of fun and is apparently extremely powerful. If it&rsquo;s anything like Haskell, then I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll love fiddling with it &hellip; especially when it&rsquo;s got the backing of the .NET framework to leverage from. For your info, I stumbled on <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc164244.aspx?pr=blog" title="F#: Use Functional Programming Techniques in the .NET Framework">this little doozy</a> which is quite an interesting read.</p>

<p><h2>ASP.NET MVC</h2>
I&rsquo;ve dabbled with <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/" title="Ruby on Rails">Ruby on Rails</a> in the past, and while I liked it I wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;blown away&rdquo; by it like so many other people. The <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/" title="Ruby Programming Language">Ruby</a> language is a nice one to work with, but I feel that the interpreter needs a bit more work before I could consider it a serious choice for my needs. On top of that, Rails isn&rsquo;t exactly blisteringly fast. So when the <a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc/" title="ASP.NET MVC">ASP.NET MVC</a> appeared I was excited at the chance to toy with something that would fit a similar mould to Rails (as far as structure is concerned) but based on .NET (allowing me to toy with a few different languages). I&rsquo;ve been a ASP.NET WebForms dev for many years now, and I never really liked the Page Model. I believe that the MVC framework is a really good step in the right direction, and I hope that when the time comes, Microsoft decides to cull the old Page Model and push ahead with the MVC as the main ASP.NET development framework. I think that this is going to be &ldquo;the way of the future&rdquo; as far as web development is concerned, so it&rsquo;s definitely worth taking for a spin. There are stacks of resources out there to help learn, so if you&rsquo;ve got time and have an interest in this sort of thing then check it out.</p>

<p><h2>WPF</h2>
The latest fad from Microsoft in the rich-client area is <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/netframework/aa663326.aspx" title="Windows Presentation Foundation">WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)</a>. I&rsquo;ve always been an advocate for rich-client applications over web applications. Being a game dev geek and a fan of graphics with rich user interfaces, I&rsquo;m always interested to play with new libraries and technologies that make it easier to develop such applications. It looks like a great technology that really does make <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Forms" title="Windows Forms">WinForms</a> look primitive. It&rsquo;s a worthy option if you&rsquo;re going to do some rich client dev.</p>

<p><h2>Silverlight</h2>
Is it a killer for Flash? Who knows, but it&rsquo;s a worthy contender. <a href="http://silverlight.net/" title="Silverlight">Silverlight</a> is essentially a direct competitor of Adobe&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flash/about/" title="Flash">Flash</a> product. It runs on the .NET platform (again) and is a subset of WPF (I believe, correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong). It looks to be a viable way of getting rich interaction over the web.</p>

<p><h2>Flash</h2>
As mentioned already, <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flash/about/" title="Flash">Flash</a> is Adobe&rsquo;s product which delivers rich experiences over the web (they acquired it when they bought Macromedia). It&rsquo;s a cross-platform doohicky and runs on <a href="http://www.actionscript.com/" title="ActionScript">ActionScript</a>. It&rsquo;s been around for a long time and has a huge established user-base. I have also heard rumblings that Adobe are going to be releasing a tool which allows you to write code in other languages (such as C++) and convert it to ActionScript for use in Flash. Pretty nifty really! I think it&rsquo;s a good move if they hope to stay in the game now that Sliverlight is a player.</p>

<p><h2>Merb</h2>
<a href="http://merbivore.com/" title="Merb">Merb</a> is a Ruby MVC development framework which is a viable alternative to Rails. If you&rsquo;re happy to ignore the performance issues of Ruby and feel the need to build a web application with it, I&rsquo;d recommend checking out Merb. I&rsquo;ve heard some really good things about it.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re my current areas of interest. Feel free to post with stuff that&rsquo;s sparking your interest! Cheers.</p>
