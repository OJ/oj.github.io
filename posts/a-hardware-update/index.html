	<h1> A Hardware Update </h1>
	  
	  <span class="text-muted">Posted by:&nbsp;Fri Jan 4, 2008</span>

	  <p>As I mentioned in a previous post, I have been getting tired of the keyboard that I have at home. I&rsquo;ve had it since December 2004, and it&rsquo;s well past its use-by date. I bought it while living in the UK and hence it has the UK keyboard layout. This was fine while I <em>lived</em> in the UK, but has been a nuisance since being back in Australia. Every other keyboard that I use has the US layout. So every time I come home I end up making mistakes while typing because keys aren&rsquo;t where my head thinks they are! Aside from the layout issue, some keys were starting to get a bit dodgey and were failing to recognise keypresses.</p>

<p>Today I finally replaced it. I invested in a new <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/mouseandkeyboard/productdetails.aspx?pid=043" title="Microsoft Natural Ergonomic 4000">Microsoft Natural Ergonomic 4000</a> keyboard which feels really comfortable. In the past I&rsquo;ve avoided these funky shaped keyboards as they haven&rsquo;t really felt right, but this one really does feel good. It has a stack of extra features and buttons, and I think it&rsquo;ll have a well-deserved existence on my desktop. The keys are nice and quiet, and they don&rsquo;t seem to struggle to register like the old one did (a good sign for a new keyboard I know ;)).</p>

<p>There is but one small issue - the space bar. While the other keys are just fine, the space bar is one noisy key. It dishes out quite a clunk each time it&rsquo;s pushed. The reason for this is that if I don&rsquo;t push it hard enough the bugger won&rsquo;t godown (see, there&rsquo;s a classic example of it). To get it to push down, I have to hit it quite hard and that&rsquo;s where the noise is coming from. Right now I&rsquo;m a little concerned about it, and I&rsquo;m hoping that it&rsquo;ll get quieter and less noisy as it &ldquo;wears in&rdquo;.</p>

<p>While I was shopping I thought I may as well fix a couple of other issues that I have mentioned in my other post about <a href="/posts/reactivate-again/" title="Reactivate? AGAIN?!">activation</a>.</p>

<p>First of all I now have a new stick of RAM, so I&rsquo;m back up to 1GB. Unfortunately I can&rsquo;t go any higher due to my borked motherboard, but it&rsquo;ll do for now. There is a noticable difference in speed now that I&rsquo;m back up to that amount.</p>

<p>Next up I bought some more <a href="http://www.articsilver.com/as5.htm" title="Artic Silver">Artic Silver</a> thermal grease. I was informed a while back by a mate (Marc) that I&rsquo;d botched the grease job on my GPU and hence the temps were stupidly high. So I&rsquo;ve grabbed some more of this stuff to fix it up. I&rsquo;ll get to that over the weekend, and hopefully we&rsquo;ll see an improvement in GPU temperatures.</p>

<p>Lastly, I bought a new webcam. I did have a <a href="http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/480/3378&cl=au,en" title="Logitech QuickCam Messenger">Logitech QuickCam Messenger</a>, but it was basically a pile of shit because:<ol><li>The image quality was awful.</li><li>It didn&rsquo;t work on Vista.</li><li>It didn&rsquo;t work on x64.</li><li>It didn&rsquo;t work on Linux.</li></ol>I did a bit of research, and ended up buying a <a href="http://au.creative.com/products/product.asp?category=218&subcategory=219&product=15969&listby=" title="Creative WebCam Vista">Creative WebCam Vista</a>, which has nothing to do with Microsoft&rsquo;s Vista. For AUD $20 you seriously can&rsquo;t go wrong. The camera is a fantastic purchase and does everything I need it to!</p>

<p>On the whole I&rsquo;m happy with my purchases. I just hope this damned space bar doesn&rsquo;t ruin it all!</p>
