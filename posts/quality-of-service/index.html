    <p>First of all, Happy New Year!</p>

<p>Now that the formalities are out of the way, I&rsquo;ll get stuck into the post :)</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s comments are inspired a by a recent experience I had with an online form (of all things!). Being a bit of a game geek, both in the &lsquo;build&rsquo; and &lsquo;play&rsquo; senses, I constantly read a lot of gaming stuff.  One thing that I&rsquo;m a fairly regular reader of is <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/" title="GamaSutra">GamaSutra</a>, as it&rsquo;s got lots of juicy game development stuff in it - a great read for people such as myself.  I finished reading a column on <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20070110/ledour_01.shtml" title="Localizing Brands and Licenses">Localizing Brands and Licenses</a> (sorry for the en-US spelling ;)), which was surprisingly interesting (albeit a little bit long) when I noticed a link at the top of the page saying &ldquo;Game Developer Magazine&rdquo;.  At this point I thought it&rsquo;d be interesting to see how much it would cost to subscribe so I followed the link (and my nose) through the maze of the web to find myself at the subscription form.</p>

<p>This is where the fun started.</p>

<p>While filling out the form with the required details (name, skin colour, sexual preference, etc) I hit the inevitable &ldquo;address&rdquo; section.  The first thing that I thought was strange was that it was asking for my address.  I was signing up to a digitally distributed magazine, and hence the only address they should have required was an email address.  Despite this bit of common sense, I though perhaps they&rsquo;d need it to verify credit card details, so I went ahead and punched it all in. When I hit the submit button, I was confused. An error came back asking me to specify a &ldquo;state&rdquo; for both billing <em>and</em> shipping addresses. This was particularly interesting since there was absolutely no mention of a shipping address on the form, let alone an area in which to enter it.  I assumed this was a minor bug in the system, and that if the billing address was fine then the shipping address would simple reflect that of the billing address.  So I went back to the billing address section of the form to look for the problem.  Being the intuitive fellow that I am, I assumed that since the error mentioned the &ldquo;state&rdquo; needed to be specified, I went straight to the &ldquo;state&rdquo; field to see what I had entered (in case there was an accidental blunder).  The option that I had chosen had been reset to the default, which I assume was done when the page refreshed with the error, so I had to choose an option again.  I think a picture of the options is probably the best way of showing you what I was facing, so have a look at this:</p>

<p><img id="image168" src="/uploads/2007/01/state.PNG" alt="The State Drop-Down" class="InlineImageBlock" /></p>

<p>As you can see, it&rsquo;s yet another example of ignorance by a United States web page.  This is going to sound a little like a Yankee Bash, and I&rsquo;m sorry for that, but I am sick to death of so many American web sites like this refused to acknowledge that the rest of the world (other than Canada) exists. You get to choose an American/Canadian state, or &ldquo;Not Available&rdquo;, and that&rsquo;s it. So, since I live in Australia, I had no choice but to choose &ldquo;Not Available&rdquo;.  I hit submit again and got the same error.</p>

<p>So in a nutshell, it&rsquo;s too bad if you want a digital subscription to the magazine if you live outside the USA because the payment form just refuses to let you enter your details.  Rather than let myself get too narked, I thought I&rsquo;d get in touch with them and let them know that their form was broken.  I took the time to fire up the support page, and send them a stack of information on the scenario.  I told them the steps, the order of events, and the information that I had specified, and the resulting error.  The comment wasn&rsquo;t rude, and if anything gave too much information on how to reproduce the problem.  After hitting &lsquo;send&rsquo; I though that I&rsquo;d hear back within 24 hours and the problem would hopefully be rectified.</p>

<p><em>Four</em> working days later I got a response, and it was not what I expected.  I have actually deleted the email so I can&rsquo;t paste the content, but I do remember the gist of it, which kinda goes like this:<blockquote>Mr Reeves,</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Company X with regards to your problem.  You can subscribe to the magazine by sending a cheque to [insert long USA address here] along with your details.</p>

<p>Regards,
The Company X Team</blockquote></p>

<p>WTF?! No mention of the problem, no mention of a solution, no comments at all about being sorry that the issue even existed. Instead, all I got was a &ldquo;send via snail mail&rdquo;.  I thought this was unbelievable - yet not surprising.  I probably don&rsquo;t need to tell you that I didn&rsquo;t bother with their suggestion.</p>

<p>The thing that really baffles me about this is the loss of business.  As a business, you don&rsquo;t want to turn clients away.  Providing them with a workaround isn&rsquo;t the same as fixing the problem - this is just bad quality of service.  Not only have they lost me as a possible client, but the problem hasn&rsquo;t been fixed, which means other people who live outside the USA/Canada are going to have the same issues signing up.</p>

<p>My frustration with the rampant stupidity in the human race increases all the time :) I&rsquo;ll finish by quoting something I read in <a href="http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/01/oops.html" title="Oops">Scott Adam&rsquo;s blog</a> today:<blockquote>&hellip; its getting harder every day to be an optimist.</blockquote></p>
