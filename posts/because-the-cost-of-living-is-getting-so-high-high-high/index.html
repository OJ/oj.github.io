	<h1> Because the Cost of Living is Getting so High, High, High </h1>
	  
	  <span class="text-muted">Posted by:&nbsp;Sun Apr 6, 2008</span>

	  <p><a href="http://www.xavierrudd.com/" title="Xavier Rudd">Xavier Rudd</a> has <a href="http://www.thelyricarchive.com/song/1721539-223666/Famine" title="Famine">hit the nail on the head</a> with that song. It&rsquo;s becoming more and more evident that our cash isn&rsquo;t going as far as it used to.</p>

<p>It has been very difficult not to notice that the cost of everything we do is just sky-rocketing. Today, after another extremely expensive trip to the shops, it hit me full in the face.</p>

<p>Last time I bought groceries it set me back $400. That&rsquo;s right, $400! That was just over a week and half ago. Now this was one of those shop-loads where so many &ldquo;non-regulars&rdquo; made it into the list all at once. Batches of shampoo, stacks of nappies, laundry detergent, shaving gel (which lasts me ages ;) ), etc. Now there are a few expensive bits in there, but nothing that can justify the leap from the usual $250 to the $400 mark.</p>

<p>I went home disgruntled, taking it on the chin. I was hoping that it was a one-off. Since then I&rsquo;ve had to go back to the shops to pick up some bits and pieces. Today, I had to do another smaller load. I thought that there&rsquo;d be a good chance that it would drop back down to the usual sum, and yet despite having a <strong>lot</strong> less stuff in the trolley, I still managed to clock up another $320.</p>

<p>As a rough guess, that takes our shopping tally for the last 3 or 4 weeks to around the $800 to $900 mark. That&rsquo;s just insane! I&rsquo;m not buying stuff that I don&rsquo;t normally buy. I&rsquo;m not going all out and buying the best brands for everything. I&rsquo;m not buying things that I don&rsquo;t need, or that are considered luxuries. So <acronym title="What the fuck">WTF</acronym> is going on here? Why are things costing so much? How come a bottle of juice now costs over $5? Why is it that two bits of chicken breast are approaching $10 a hit? How can milk be over $4 for just 2L?</p>

<p>When we got back from the <acronym title="United Kingdom">UK</acronym> back in &lsquo;06 we noticed that the cost of living in general had increased. It&rsquo;s more obvious now. A few other things that I&rsquo;ve noticed (some of these things I buy, some I don&rsquo;t):
<ul>
<li>Cans of soft drink: $1.30 to $3.</li>
<li>Petrol: currently hovering around the $1.30/L here in Queensland despite the apparent government subsidy. It&rsquo;s easily approaching $1.50 in some of the other states.</li>
<li>Loaf of bread: $3. They&rsquo;re smaller, and they go stale <em>quickly</em>.</li>
<li>Fruit and veg: prices going up, quality going down. We produce insane amounts of food, yet the good stuff is exported and the crap is imported.</li>
<li>Standard sized bar of chocolate: $2. What happened here!?</li>
<li>Plain old vanilla milkshake at a local cafe: $4.50.</li>
<li>Bowl of chips: $6.</li>
<li>Chicken buger: $8.</li>
<li>Bananas: $8/kg.</li>
<li>Fresh sandwich at lunch: $7.</li>
</ul>
The list goes on and on. I&rsquo;m becoming more and more stunned that the cost of some of the most basic things can be so high. It makes me wonder how so many people survive. I know of families with a single income that&rsquo;s very low, multiple children and a mortgage &ndash; it makes me wonder how they do it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not going to start talking about the cost of housing, renting, building, mortgages etc because I&rsquo;ll be talking all night. Suffice is to say that right now in Australian, attempting to own your own home is a nightmare of gargantuan proportions. Interest rates are going up almost as fast as the cost of houses themselves.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s nuts. I wonder how long it&rsquo;ll keep up, and what the longer term affects of burgeoning economy will be. Right now I&rsquo;m a little scared.</p>

<p>Anyhooo, have a listen to Xavier <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhmlBUszCr0" title="Xavier Rudd - Famine - Shorline 2006">playing the song live</a>, it&rsquo;s great :)

<p>Note: I do realise that I might come across as a whining affluent, and I&rsquo;m sure there are many people out there who are in a tougher situation than me. That doesn&rsquo;t mean I have to like having to fork out more and more for the same stuff while the quality goes down.</p>
