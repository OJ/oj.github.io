    <p>After reading Dan&rsquo;s response to <a href="/posts/is-an-ide-all-its-cracked-up-to-be/" title="Is an IDE all it's cracked up to be?">this</a> a few days ago, I decided to have a bit of a play with Notepad++. I do think it&rsquo;s a very nice little text editor with some lovely features. It&rsquo;s quitck, it&rsquo;s simple, and the syntax hilighting works a treat (no thanks to Scintilla of course). One thing I do like is that by default when line numbering is on and word-wrap is enabled, gaps appear between the numbers to indicate that a line has wrapped (I need to set up something like this with VIM, as it&rsquo;s one of the things that&rsquo;s currently driving me nuts). It&rsquo;s a shame it&rsquo;s Windows only! I now have it installed at work and I used it when I work on quite a few different things including stored procedures, general markup (XML/HTML/etc), and some other bits and pieces of code.</p>

<p>A couple of nights ago I also decided to install <a href="http://www.xemacs.org/" title="XEmacs">XEmacs</a> to see what it was like to edit text. So many people love Emacs and there are just as many evangelists for this as their are VI/VIM. I found it to be very much like VIM, but there was one thing that stood out which I didn&rsquo;t quite like. That is, the command mode seemed to be extremely heavy on the use of the CTRL and ALT keys. That may sound like a petty whinge to you, but for me, having to keep at least one of my little fingers at the bottom of the keyboard while I&rsquo;m moving around becomes painful. I like VIM&rsquo;s idea of not having to move any fingers away from the home row if you want to move up/down/left/right by a single line/character. Pressing CTRL every time is a bit of overkill in my opinion, and it&rsquo;s a bit off-putting for me. After going through a few tutorials with I noticed that my hands were becoming strained. I&rsquo;m pretty sure this is partly down to my typing style (because I&rsquo;m not a perfect touch-typist, I tend to use my left little finger for SHIFT and CTRL rather than alternating depending on the key I am pressing).</p>

<p>So the result is that I&rsquo;ve decided to cut short my time with Emacs and carry on doing my best to learn VIM. I can use VIM enough to be able to do my work, but I&rsquo;m still frustrated because I know I&rsquo;m nowhere near being the power user that I dream to be. It&rsquo;s all about the practice. I do find myself getting annoyed at the fact that I have to constantly refer to the quick-ref guide to do some of the basic things, but I&rsquo;m sure this will happen less and less over time.</p>

<p>I am still on the search for the ultimate development environment though. I do feel that having something which is a combination of VIM and Visual Studio would be awesome. I am even thinking of putting some time aside to build it myself. In my mind I have a vision of a unified IDE which not only has in-built support for debugging code, but has features such as memory windows, call stacks, etc - combined with the power of VIM for editing text, and the generic &ldquo;Windows&rdquo; functionality of things like CTRL-TAB for moving across buffers (yes, I know you can configure VIM to do this).</p>

<p>I have a question for everyone :) I&rsquo;ve done only a little bit of true development on a *nix machine, and I&rsquo;m interested to know which tools most people use when <em>they</em> develop for *nix. I&rsquo;d even be interested to know what you&rsquo;d use for <strong>Mac</strong> development?! Are there are good selection of environments to use? Or is it all Emacs/VIM with a bunch of plugins? I realise VIM comes with some form of autocomplete, which I&rsquo;m yet to play with, but how well does this work? Is it smart enough to autocomplete on functions names that don&rsquo;t exist in the current file scope? Do your respective text editors have any support for intellisense? What is the <em>project-wide</em> support like? Is it really a pain in the butt to get debugging working? How easy it is to have your editor build your project for you without you having to manually create build files?</p>

<p>Yup, I can get these answers of <a href="http://www.google.com.au/" title="Google">Google</a>, but I&rsquo;m interested to hear the thoughts of the folks that find themselves reading this :D</p>

<p>As a final point, me ol&rsquo; mucka Keef pointed out that games developers are in a way &lsquo;forced&rsquo; to use Visual Studio, and to a point I agree. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean to say that you can&rsquo;t use something like VIM for basic coding tasks if you really want to. I used to work with a guy who was a real Emacs junkie, and that&rsquo;s all he used for his dev work (that includes Win32/C++ coding through to HTML, C# and ASP). All the compiling and debugging was done from Emacs, and he seemed to be very productive with it - something I&rsquo;m nowhere near achieving with VIM :)</p>
