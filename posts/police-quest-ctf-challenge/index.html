	<h1> Police Quest CTF Challenge </h1>
	  
	  <span class="text-muted">Posted by:&nbsp;Mon Nov 26, 2018</span>

	  

<p><img style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px" src="/uploads/2018/11/pq.png" width="300px"/>
Earlier this month, I donated a CTF challenge to the legendary bunch of folks that ran the <a href="https://www.kiwicon.org">Kiwicon</a> CTF in Wellington. It&rsquo;s a bit of a tradition for me to pass on at least one challenge, and I felt it was worth keeping that tradition going this year.</p>

<p>The challenge was attempted by a few people during the conference, however I don&rsquo;t believe it was successfully owned. As a result, I wanted to release this to the general public for funzies.</p>

<p>In short, this thing is a Linux binary exploitation challenge. It&rsquo;s a 64-bit binary, and has a few interesting quirks that you need to get around. My aims for this challenge were:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create something that was interesting!</li>
<li>Build an application that was &ldquo;fun&rdquo; to interact with that happened to have some security concerns, rather than a shell of an application with a bug in it.</li>
<li>Force people to work through a series of issues, rather than getting a flag due to a single bug.</li>
<li>Make good use of most of the relevant security protections available today.</li>
<li>Try to make it reasonably realistic.</li>
<li>Try to make it <em>hard</em> without making it stupid. Many challenges I&rsquo;ve seen in the past tend to be hard for the sake of it and result in not giving any ideas as to how things can be solved. I hope that the method required to solve this shows itself as you progress, while making you work for each and every step.</li>
<li>Create something that had both dynamic and static analysis elements.</li>
<li>Create a learning experience for people.</li>
</ol>

<p>Based on the feedback so far from my playtesters I think I nailed a good chunk of the brief. I look forward to hearing what you have to say about it.</p>

<p>So the result is something that I called <strong>Police Quest</strong>, in the spirit of the old school Seirra games. Why? Well we had a theme for the CTF that we were building last year, and this fit within the theme. Plus I loved those games, so why not. It&rsquo;s a mini-mud that may keep you entertained for a few hours.</p>

<p>I also hope that this nerd-snipes lots of people who end up hating me.</p>

<h2 id="where-to-get-it">Where to get it</h2>

<p>Full details of the challenge can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/OJ/police-quest">Github Repo</a>. The easiest thing to do is clone the repo, as this gives you the binary to work on, and a Docker container that has the challenge running in it. You can use the <code>Makefile</code> to spin the container up.</p>

<h2 id="with-thanks-to">With thanks to &hellip;</h2>

<p>As always there are a bunch of people behind the scenes who helped get this thing on the road. In no particular order:</p>

<ul>
<li>Thank you <a href="https://twitter.com/justinsteven">Justin</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/_smashery_">Smash</a> for being my play-testers and making sure that the thing was understandable, and doable.</li>
<li>Thank you <a href="https://twitter.com/ausjock">Shaun</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/rickoates">Rick</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/_switch_">Silas</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/0x42424242">Ryan</a> for offering opinions and feedback along the way and helping me polish the story.</li>
<li>Thank you to the Kiwicon crew for letting me include this challenge in their CTF.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>If you decide to give this a go, please feel free to create a video, blog post, or whatever else takes your fancy and publish it somewhere that people can get to. If you do, then let me know, as I&rsquo;d love to see how you solve it. I&rsquo;ll release the source code to the binary to each person that solves it themselves, if they&rsquo;re interested.</p>

<p>Feedback as always is welcome. Thanks again, and enjoy!</p>

<p>OJ</p>
