	<h1> Another New Keyboard </h1>
	  
	  <span class="text-muted">Posted by:&nbsp;Fri Mar 28, 2008</span>

	  <p>A little while ago I <a href="/posts/a-hardware-update/" title="A Hardware Update">posted</a> about some new hardware that I bought. In that update I mentioned that I&rsquo;d bought a new keyboard because my old one was a bit shaky and had the old UK layout which was no longer valid since I have now returned to Australia.</p>

<p>The keyboard that I bought, a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/mouseandkeyboard/productdetails.aspx?pid=043">Microsoft Natural Ergonomic 4000</a>, was one that I had seen recommended on a few sites. I was told that the keyboard was good to use, was comfy, and that it was quiet. After reading the reviews I decided to take the plunge.</p>

<p>Since buying that keyboard, I&rsquo;ve barely touched my desktop computer. <em>That</em> is how much I disliked the keyboard. Instead I stuck with my laptop. My pokey, slow, Vista-infected laptop rather than my dual-screen, dual-boot desktop. Sure it was comfy as far as the hands were concerned, but the layout just didn&rsquo;t feel right. It could be that I&rsquo;m too used to having to use the standard keyboards that the ergonomic ones just don&rsquo;t feel right. On top of that, the issue of the <strong>incredibly noisy spacebar</strong> was one that I just couldn&rsquo;t get past. The rest of the keyboard was relatively quiet, but that damned spacebar required approximately 150N of force applied to it before the damned thing would budge. Silicon lubricant did nothing. The only way to make it budge was to hit it, and hit it hard. Needless to say, it was uncomfortable and <em>very</em> noisy.</p>

<p>For the sake of this discussion, I won&rsquo;t go into detail about the extra keys which were really tacky. Let&rsquo;s just say they sucked, and they felt flimsy.</p>

<p>I went back to the drawing board and started researching again. This time I came across a keyboard that took my eye straight away. One that was recommended by another mate, and a man who updates his hardware more often than anyone I&rsquo;ve ever met (you know who you are ;)). Again, I did some reading and decided to take the plunge - scared that I might end up making the same mistake.</p>

<p><a href="/uploads/2008/03/2007951535362581.jpg" title="Enermax Aurora Premium" rel="lightbox[enermax]"><img src="/uploads/2008/03/2007951535362581.jpg" alt="Enermax Aurora Premium" style="float: left; padding-right: 3px; padding-bottom: 3px; border: 0;" width="120" /></a>I didn&rsquo;t. This keyboard is a dream. It&rsquo;s saved my desktop machine from total banishment! My saviour: the <a href="http://www.enermaxusa.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=28_48&products_id=137" title="Enermax Aurora KB007U Premium">Enermax Aurora KB007U Premium</a>.</p>

<p>Make no mistake, ladies and gentlemen, this keyboard will make you feel like you&rsquo;ve died and gone to heaven. I could spend hours and hours dribbling on about how this keyboard makes me happy downstairs, but instead I&rsquo;ll try and sum it up in these few points.
<a href="/uploads/2008/03/20079515381429142.gif" title="Enermax Aurora Premium - Closeup" rel="lightbox[enermax]"><img src="/uploads/2008/03/20079515381429142.gif" alt="Enermax Aurora Premium - Closeup" style="float: right; padding-left: 3px; padding-bottom: 3px; border: 0;" width="120" /></a><ol><li>Brushed aluminium keyboard - nice and heavy. You will not see this keyboard moving around the desktop as you try to type. It&rsquo;s also nice and cool on the hands.</li><li>Tactile response on the keys is just fantastic, and is incredibly quiet. The act of typing is a joy.</li><li>Standard layout - no keys added or removed. They&rsquo;re exactly where they should be.</li><li>USB 2.0. Say no more :) Nice and responsive.</li><li>Just so happens to come with a USB 2.0 hub as well. This will definitely get some use!</li><li>Also comes with audio jacks for those people who feel the need to use them - this isn&rsquo;t something I&rsquo;ll be using, but it&rsquo;s a nice to have feature.</li></ol>Seriously, I can&rsquo;t begin to say how happy I am that I have this keyboard.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re in the market for a new keyboard, and you&rsquo;ve got the dosh, make sure you invest in one of these. You won&rsquo;t regrest it.</p>
