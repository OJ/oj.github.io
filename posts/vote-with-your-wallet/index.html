	<h1> Vote with your Wallet </h1>
	  
	  <span class="text-muted">Posted by:&nbsp;Wed Dec 5, 2007</span>

	  <p>In a <a href="/posts/living-in-australia-has-a-downside/" title="Living in Australia has a Downside">previous post</a> I had a bit of a combined whinge about MS downloads and bandwidth limits in Australia. Today I read a <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/technology/phone-and-broadband-bills-to-rise/posts/1196530678984.html" title="Phone and broadband bills to rise">new article at SMH</a> that made me even more angry.</p>

<p>For those who don&rsquo;t know, Australia&rsquo;s broadband/phone network is predominantly owned and controlled by <a href="http://www.telstra.com/" title="Telstra">Telstra</a>. In short, this company is largely responsible for the issues. Not only do they charge insane amounts for their shitty service, they&rsquo;re going to be charging more down the track. The cost of phone line rental is extremely high. Their Internet plans are a joke. The service network is terrible, and just don&rsquo;t even think about getting support over the phone from someone who know&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>

<p>When I first started looking for a broadband provider back in 2003, I decided to avoid Telstra because their plans didn&rsquo;t seem to be as competitive as others. Instead, I decided to go with a company that I am actually using now (<a href="http://www.internode.on.net/" title="Internode">Internode</a>). The process of signing up looked to be fairly simple, so I filled in the online form and away we went.</p>

<p>About 2 days later I was informed by Internode that they weren&rsquo;t able to provision a connection on my phone line for some wierd reason. They told me that the issue is with Telstra, because they own the line, and that I should give them a call to find out what the problem is.</p>

<p>Upon calling Telstra I was told that they weren&rsquo;t able to help me. They said that they had a reason for rejecting the connection request, but they would consider looking into the problem if, and only if, I signed up with <em>them</em> and not Internode.</p>

<p>I was stunned! In no so many words, the lady on the other end of the phone had basically said that if I sign up with Telstra I&rsquo;d get a connection, but I&rsquo;d be rejected if I went through Internode. I decided to stick with dial-up rather than give them my cash.</p>

<p>Thankfully things have now changed, and I no longer live in a spot where there are issues on the line. But that at least gives you an idea of what Telstra is like to deal with. From what I&rsquo;ve heard, these days they&rsquo;re even worse.</p>

<p>The idea of them winning the tender to sort out the Internet infrastructure in this country just gives me the shivers. I mean, they say it themselves:<blockquote><p>Just this week Telstra&rsquo;s public policy chief, Phil Burgess, admitted the company&rsquo;s strategy was to become a &ldquo;premium provider charging premium prices&rdquo;.</p></blockquote>That&rsquo;s straight from the horses mouth! If that&rsquo;s not enough evidence, check this out:<blockquote><p>Telstra will not want to reduce margins because it has promised shareholders it will increase the company&rsquo;s overall pre-tax profit margins from 42 per cent to between 46 and 48 per cent by 2010.</p></blockquote>Are they thinking about the consumer? Hell no. It&rsquo;s all about bleeding you dry.</p>

<p>Something needs to be done. I&rsquo;m voting with my wallet, and telling Telstra to go f**k themselves by signing up with a competitor. You can do the same. Right now I&rsquo;m looking for ways to completely remove myself from any of Telstra&rsquo;s services and I know I&rsquo;ll feel better for doing it.</p>

<p>I think you will too :)</p>
