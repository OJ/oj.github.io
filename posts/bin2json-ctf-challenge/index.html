	<h1> bin2json CTF Challenge </h1>
	  
	  <span class="text-muted">Posted by:&nbsp;Mon Nov 21, 2016</span>

	  

<p>At the beginning of this year I agreed to help a <a href="https://twitter.com/0x42424242">good friend</a> out and build a challenge for the <a href="http://www.bsidesau.com.au/">BSidesCbr</a> 2016 CTF. The aim was to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a fun binary pwnable.</li>
<li>Avoid the typical exploitation paths (eg. stack/heap buffer overflows, format strings, etc).</li>
<li>Include a couple of code related issues that are close to my heart.</li>
<li>Design it so that multiple issues needed to be abused in order to gain code execution.</li>
<li>Have it considered at least an &ldquo;intermediate&rdquo; level challenge.</li>
</ul>

<p>The result: <a href="/uploads/2016/11/bin2json-bin.tar.gz">bin2json</a>, a pwnable 64-bit Linux binary.</p>

<p>I had another good mate, <a href="https://twitter.com/justinsteven">Justin Steven</a>, play-test the binary for me to make sure it was reasonable, usable and pwnable, and after ignoring all the feedback he gave me, I handed it over to <a href="https://twitter.com/0x42424242">Peleus</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, nobody managed to crack it during the BSides CTF. I didn&rsquo;t want to just throw it out to the masses immediately, and so I hit up the wonderful CTF crew at <a href="https://kiwicon.org/">Kiwicon</a>, headed up by <a href="https://twitter.com/hyprwired">Hyprwired</a>, and offered them to chance to include it in this year&rsquo;s Kiwicon CTF. They graciously accepted.</p>

<p>The binary made it through the second CTF un-pwned, though I do think that it was due to lack of sufficient time rather than difficulty. After two CTFs, it&rsquo;s time for <a href="/uploads/2016/11/bin2json-bin.tar.gz">bin2json</a> to retire. So, I am opening it up to the Internet (yes, that&rsquo;s you!) so that you can give it a crack. I&rsquo;d love to see people spend some time and nail it.</p>

<p>For those who don&rsquo;t want to, or who don&rsquo;t yet feel that they&rsquo;re ready for it, you&rsquo;ll be pleased to know that <a href="https://twitter.com/justinsteven">Justin Steven</a> is going to be streaming the process of pwnage <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/thejustinsteven">live on his Twitch stream</a> on Wednesday 23rd November 2016, at 7:30pm AEST (GMT+10). I highly recommend viewing, he&rsquo;s an entertaining bugger and does a great job of explaining stuff. He&rsquo;s recently got himself a new mic, so his dulcet tones sound all the more saucy.</p>

<p>I have decided, at this point, to not release the <a href="/uploads/2016/11/bin2json-bin.tar.gz">bin2json</a> source. For now, you will just get:</p>

<ul>
<li>The binary.</li>
<li>The readme.</li>
<li>A sample script that shows how to interact with it.</li>
</ul>

<p>That&rsquo;s it. I may share the source later. The rest of this post contains the official readme for the challenge, so have at it!</p>

<p>Peace.</p>

<h1 id="the-scenario">The Scenario</h1>

<p>Back in the days of <em>quality</em> Enterprise software, a company called Totes McPants Pty Ltd had a proprietary solution for tracking various entities within a business or team. This application, Simple Human Instance Tracker, was a market leader until it unfortunately went EOL in 1999.</p>

<p>Stalwart users refused to give up on it. Instead of moving over to a more appropriate solution, they continued using that which was defunct, and over a very long period of time managed to accumulate more data than they ever though possible.</p>

<p>In 2015, one of the application&rsquo;s long-term users and proponents of S.H.I.T. found themselves in a position where they needed to integrate with external RESTful services. Needless to say, there was no REST-compatible interface available and so one had to be built.</p>

<p>This web-scale integration solution was built and deployed to great success, and has been made available as a service at <em>server:port</em>. It will happily translate S.H.I.T.&rsquo;s proprietary data format to (relatively) clean JSON for use externally.</p>

<h1 id="the-format">The Format</h1>

<p>S.H.I.T.&rsquo;s format is actually very simple, and the transition layer extends it slightly by providing a very simple command style interface. Once connected, the system waits for a binary blob to be sent which contains a number of actions. There are two actions:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>CREATE PERSON</code> (action value of <code>0</code>: This action is intended to create an instance of a person using the S.H.I.T. binary person format.</li>
<li><code>PRINT</code> (action value of <code>1</code>): This action prints all the &ldquo;created&rdquo; people in a nice JSON format.</li>
</ul>

<p>Action values are a single-byte in length.</p>

<h2 id="create-person">CREATE PERSON</h2>

<p>There are 3 types of person available:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>ENGINEER</code> (type value of <code>1</code>) - This person type has a single value that represents how humourous the person is (as we all know, engineers have a great sense of humour). This value is an integer value 4 bytes in length. A sample byte sequence may look like:

<ul>
<li><code>[0x01][&quot;Uncle Bob&quot; (padded to 512 chars)][0xFF,0x00,0x00,0x00]</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>HACKER</code> (type value of <code>0</code>) - This is an extension of the <code>ENGINEER</code> but has an extra field called <code>Handle</code> at the end which is <code>256</code> characters long.

<ul>
<li><code>[0x00][&quot;Rob Fuller&quot; (padded to 512 chars)][0xFF,0xAB,0x00,0x00][&quot;Mubix&quot; (padded to 256 chars)]</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>MANAGER (type value of <code>2</code>) - This is a person with a single extra 4-byte integer value that represents how much of an asshole the manager is.

<ul>
<li><code>[0x02][&quot;Larry Ellison&quot; (padded to 512 chars)][0x7F,0xFF,0xFF,0xFF]</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>To create a person, each of these byte streams must be prefixed with 2 other bytes that represent:</p>

<ol>
<li>The <code>CREATE PERSON</code> action (<code>0x00</code>).</li>
<li>A flag that indicates whether the entry should be added to the head (<code>0x01</code>) or tail (<code>0x00</code>) of the internal list.</li>
</ol>

<p>Therefore to create a manager at the head of the list, the following byte stream is used:</p>

<pre><code>[0x00][0x01][0x02][&quot;Larry Ellison&quot; (padded to 512 chars)][0x7F,0xFF,0xFF,0xFF]
</code></pre>

<p>And this constitutes a single <code>CREATE PERSON</code> action.</p>

<h2 id="print">PRINT</h2>

<p>Printing is very simple, it is a single byte action represented by the value <code>0x01</code>.</p>

<h1 id="payloads">Payloads</h1>

<p>Once connected to the integration service, the client sends a series of translation payloads. Each payload contains a 4-byte size header, followed by the payload length. Each payload comes in the form of an action. A typical payload looks like the following:</p>

<pre><code>[4-byte length][[create person 0][create person 1]...[create person N][print]]
</code></pre>

<p>See the attached <code>sample.py</code> file which shows the application in action.</p>

<h1 id="notes">Notes</h1>

<p>The system assumes that every team and business has at least one Hacker. If no hacker is present in the list, printing won&rsquo;t do much!</p>

<h1 id="goal">Goal</h1>

<p>Shell the target, get the flag from the file system. ASLR is not enabled.</p>
