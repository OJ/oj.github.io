      <description>&lt;p&gt;In October last year, while conducting an internal assessment for a client in Sydney, I found a vulnerability in a vendor product. The flaw allows for remote code execution on the device, &lt;em&gt;as the root user&lt;/em&gt;, without requiring authentication. Needless to say, &amp;ldquo;instant remote root&amp;rdquo; vulnerabilities are bad. On the scale of bug severity, they&amp;rsquo;re up pretty high. For a device such as this, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really get any worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I had a working proof-of-concept which demonstrated the flaw, I made contact with the vendor in an effort to disclose the issue in a secure and responsible manner. I was aware that other options were available, such as handing the issue over to CERT or some other initiative that deals with the pain of disclosure, but I wanted to get first-hand experience of the process, hence I decided to do it myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not going to lie, it has been frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
