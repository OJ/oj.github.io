      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yet another &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dev102.com/posts/a-programming-job-interview-challenge-13-brackets/&#34; title=&#34;Programming Challenge&#34;&gt;programming challenge appeared on dev102&lt;/a&gt; the other day, and I thought that this time I&amp;rsquo;d post my solution here in the blog rather than letting it get lost in the depths of the comment thread!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post was inspired by a recent interview question that was posted over at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fsharp.it/posts/google-interview-question-product-of-other-elements-in-an-array-in-on/&#34; title=&#34;Fsharp.it&#34;&gt;fsharp.it&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s one of those neat little questions which looks really simple on the surface but is quite tricky.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Current Geek Interests</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As the weeks roll by I&amp;rsquo;m finding that I have less and less time to chase up anything geek-related. I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;m not alone ;) Responsibilities and life take over and that time which you &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; invest is now invested in other things, such as &lt;a href=&#34;/posts/my-boy/&#34; title=&#34;My Boy&#34;&gt;children&lt;/a&gt; :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m dedicating this post to all those things that I currently find interesting and would love to invest time in. Some of these things are old, some new. All of them I&amp;rsquo;ve either not touched on at all, or have touched on only briefly (not enough to be satisfied). I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share them with you in case you find them interesting yourself, or perhaps have some insights which you&amp;rsquo;d like to share.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It seems that the Gods have finally smiled upon me. They have answered my request to work with smart people! I am currently fortunate enough to be working with a few Guns who are well-known in the industry. Rather than mention all of them, I&amp;rsquo;m just going to focus on one who for now happens to be in line with my current &amp;ldquo;theme&amp;rdquo; of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming&#34; title=&#34;Functional programming&#34;&gt;functional programming&lt;/a&gt; posts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
