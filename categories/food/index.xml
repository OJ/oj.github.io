      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a very long time since I last ate fast food (such as McDonalds, KFC or Hungry Jacks). In fact, it&amp;rsquo;s been years, because I just can&amp;rsquo;t stand the stuff and I know it&amp;rsquo;s really bad for me.
When it comes to other types of junk I&amp;rsquo;m pretty good. The only time I ever eat potato chips is when my mate Mike pops round and brings them with him. I never buy them myself, and they don&amp;rsquo;t make it into our shopping cart when we buy groceries.</description>
