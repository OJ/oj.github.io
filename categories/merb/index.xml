      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about building a web application or two for a while, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t yet found the time to invest. I don&amp;rsquo;t think this is going to change very soon either. I&amp;rsquo;m not the kind of person who usually likes to get stuck into something unless I know I&amp;rsquo;ve got a couple of hours up my sleeve so that I feel I can get something done, and this has been preventing me from doing anything because I don&amp;rsquo;t ever feel like I have a couple of hours spare. Having a child means that you could have as little as 5 minutes before all hell breaks loose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of whinging about it, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to go against my usual grain and take those 5 minute chunks as a chance to do something. This is the first step :)&lt;/p&gt;</description>
