      <description>&lt;p&gt;The topic of tools is often a hot one amongst developers and every year
we see an influx of blog posts where people rant and rave about which
ones they love the most, and why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Far be it from me to stay out of such a discussion!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a list of the tools that I use as of the end of January 2012. Some are simply noteworthy.
Others are very handy and while I would get by without them they would
be missed. Some of these &lt;strong&gt;I simply cannot live without&lt;/strong&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m not going
to bother with ratings. I won&amp;rsquo;t go into frameworks or the like which
make their way into my code, instead I am focussing on those tools which
help me do the coding and which aid me in my general computer usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of these tools are platform-specific, but many can be used across
different platforms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
