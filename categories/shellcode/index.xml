      <description>&lt;p&gt;During the course of exploit development it is not uncommon to require jumps in your shellcode. The most common case for these jumps is when doing &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.corelan.be/index.php/2009/07/25/writing-buffer-overflow-exploits-a-quick-and-basic-tutorial-part-3-seh/&#34;&gt;SEH overwrites&lt;/a&gt;, due to their nature. There are times when the author of the exploit has a hard time performing these jumps due to the fact that only a subset of characters are deemed valid for use by the target application in that particular input field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post I want to briefly cover a few options for performing those jumps in such a scenario.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
