      <description>&lt;p&gt;Forgive the title of the post, it was hard coming up with something succinct that captured the purpose of the post. This was inspired by a recent experience with a client who had this exact problem with one of their production systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tl-dr&#34;&gt;TL;DR&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never use &lt;a href=&#34;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms524784(v=vs.90).aspx&#34;&gt;Request.QueryString&lt;/a&gt; to access parameters in your views, even when you&amp;rsquo;re sure your actions have validated them. You may open your application up to &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting&#34;&gt;XSS&lt;/a&gt; attacks. Always, &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; use data that is passed to your views via the &lt;code&gt;Model&lt;/code&gt; or the &lt;a href=&#34;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.mvc.viewpage.viewdata(v=vs.108).aspx&#34;&gt;ViewData&lt;/a&gt; dictionary. Under no circumstances should you trust data coming in from the web, that includes query string parameters.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>ASP.NET MVC 2, Random Sign-offs and TempData Loss</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;MVC&#34; href=&#34;/uploads/2010/10/mvc.png&#34; rel=&#34;lightbox[contentadvisor]&#34;&gt;&lt;img style=&#34;margin-left: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; float: right;&#34; src=&#34;/uploads/2010/10/mvc.png&#34; alt=&#34;MVC&#34; width=&#34;150&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In the last few days I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on resolving issues in a production system which runs on &lt;a title=&#34;What is ASP.NET MVC&#34; href=&#34;http://www.asp.net/mvc/whatisaspmvc&#34;&gt;ASP.NET MVC 2&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the issues were actually really easy to resolve and the team of developers were able to fix them and deploy to production without too many problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, as always, there was one problem in particular that had us scratching our heads and was causing some of us to lose sleep. All over the Internet there were posts of people describing similar symptoms yet none of them revealed a solid answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this post is to document the issue and the resolution in it&amp;rsquo;s entirety. It&amp;rsquo;s in story form rather than reference form because that&amp;rsquo;s how I felt like writing it :)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There comes a time in every ASP.NET developer&amp;rsquo;s life when the need arises for information to be persisted into &lt;a href=&#34;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms972976.aspx&#34; title=&#34;ViewState&#34;&gt;ViewState&lt;/a&gt;. For the sake of this post I&amp;rsquo;m not really interested in the reasons why. What I am interested in is &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you interact with your ViewState?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Isn&amp;rsquo;t it amazing how life can just hit turbo without prior warning, and your time seems to just disappear! I need to find some way of sticking blogging back into my routine :)
For the last couple of weeks I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around a fair bit with Ruby and Rails. I&amp;rsquo;ve been having a great deal of fun at the same time, and I recommend it to any of you who are thinking of taking up some of your own time with learning web development.</description>
