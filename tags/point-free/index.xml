&lt;p&gt;Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been delving into &lt;a href=&#34;http://haskell.org/&#34;&gt;Haskell&lt;/a&gt; quite a bit. It&amp;rsquo;s part of my apparently never-ending quest to learn as much as I can about as many languages as I can (well, those that appeal to me at least :)). While I love playing around with a language, toying with ideas, writing small programs, reading books, blog posts, etc it&amp;rsquo;s not really the same as having an on-call expert to help and guide you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
