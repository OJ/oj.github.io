      <description>&lt;p&gt;A short time ago I &lt;a href=&#34;/posts/websites-are-hard-to-build/&#34; title=&#34;Websites are Hard to Build&#34;&gt;posted some thoughts&lt;/a&gt; on issues faced when building websites that most people aren&amp;rsquo;t aware of when they decide to have one built. I posted from the perspective of someone who has, on many occasions, been asked to build a site for someone who really doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a clue about what is involved. More importantly, they don&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are people out there who don&amp;rsquo;t know about the issues faced, but are still in need of a site to fulfil their needs. Should they learn about these issues themselves? Should they put their faith in a developer/designer and let them do their job and just send them a bill at the end? A mixture of the two?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
