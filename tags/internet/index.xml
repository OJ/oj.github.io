      <description>&lt;p&gt;This may come as a surprise, but living in Australia &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; have it downsides :) Right now I can only think of one, and that&amp;rsquo;s (part of) the reason for this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We may have constant sunshine, lovely beaches and a lifestyle to die for, but our broadband just &lt;strong&gt;sucks&lt;/strong&gt;. That&amp;rsquo;s a fairly sweeping statement, so let me clarify a little more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Broadband plans in this country are &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; poor value. The service that you receive for the amount you pay is substandard. It&amp;rsquo;s that simple. Those of you in places like the UK, USA and Hong Kong may find it obscure to consider that a country exists where you can&amp;rsquo;t get an unlimited data connection for DSL. You may also find it difficult to believe that some connection speeds are cut to that of a dial-up connection if you download too much. But that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what happens here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
