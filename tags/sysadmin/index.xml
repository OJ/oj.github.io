      <description>Not too long ago I mentioned that I&amp;rsquo;d setup and installed Nginx on this server. All seemed well to start off with, then on certain occasions I started to notice that some pages were being served truncated while I was at work. I thought that the issue was work-related, as they have a fairly draconian security policy in place and I thought that it had something to do with severing the connection.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yes, and that admin is me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I usually do a fairly decent job of keeping the server patched, up to date, and clean. Over the Xmas period where I wasn&amp;rsquo;t really looking at anything online, something went wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I logged on this morning only to find that the server wasn&amp;rsquo;t responding. I could connect via SSH, but nothing was being served via HTTP. So I tried to reboot &lt;a href=&#34;http://litespeedtech.com/&#34; title=&#34;LiteSpeed technologies&#34;&gt;LiteSpeed&lt;/a&gt; to see if that would resolve it (as you do ;) ). The service stopped, but failed to restart!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
