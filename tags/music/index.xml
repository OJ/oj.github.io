      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most people who trundle through life, battling against the elements and working hard to achieve at work or in the home find that they need an escape. I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about just a holiday to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.whitsundaytourism.com/&#34; title=&#34;Whitsundays&#34;&gt;Whitsundays&lt;/a&gt; or a month off to go hiking in the Himalayas. I&amp;rsquo;m talking about something more regular. Something that perhaps you can do on a daily basis to help you feel more relaxed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a few. I like to do distance running. At the moment my training regime is almost non-existant because of the stuff that&amp;rsquo;s going on, but that&amp;rsquo;s something I&amp;rsquo;m going to remedy shortly. I&amp;rsquo;m going to go for runs during lunchtimes again now that I&amp;rsquo;m somewhere which has a clean shower! I find that a good long run can really make me feel good. Nothing like a bit of cardio excercise followed by a hit of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endorphin&#34; title=&#34;Endorphin&#34;&gt;endorphins&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
