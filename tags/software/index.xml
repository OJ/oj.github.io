      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here are a collection of quotes that can drive fear into the heart of every developer. They&amp;rsquo;re made worse when heard at the start of a new gig, as any hope of a brave new world is smashed before you even get a login!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&amp;gt; &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s just a small site, how hard can it be?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; &amp;ldquo;I thought you could do it for me as a favour. It&amp;rsquo;s not a complicated site.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; &amp;ldquo;This would take me an afternoon, but I don&amp;rsquo;t have time, can you do it for me?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever heard these comments before? Have you heard ones that are similar? I&amp;rsquo;ve been hearing them a lot in the last few weeks and it&amp;rsquo;s starting to get to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have just had a chat with a mate who is also suffering this pain, and that conversation is what inspired me to write this, the first random rant in a while.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
