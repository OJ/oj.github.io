      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve just come back from another run and again I&amp;rsquo;m feeling good. I did the same route as yesterday, but 6 minutes slower. It was encouraging that I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel out of breath or overly tired, the thing that got me was sore legs!
Tomorrow is going to be a rest day because I have to go and do a certification exam during lunch time which is a bit annoying. Hopefully Wednesday lunch time I&amp;rsquo;ll be rested up and ready to take on the lunchtime route again.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since before &lt;a href=&#34;/posts/more-punishment/&#34; title=&#34;More Punishment&#34;&gt;signing up for the marathon&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ve been making sure that I do my running training regularly. I&amp;rsquo;m currently doing at least 4 runs during the week, pushing for 5 (all during lunch times). The route that I run around the city is approximately 6.2km, which is a good distance to cover while still having time either side of the run for prepration and showering up so that I don&amp;rsquo;t offend my coworkers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
