      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here are a collection of quotes that can drive fear into the heart of every developer. They&amp;rsquo;re made worse when heard at the start of a new gig, as any hope of a brave new world is smashed before you even get a login!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I think the following statement goes way deeper than it may have been intended (I might be wrong of course)&amp;hellip; Engineering is about making tradeoffs. If you refuse to make the choice, then you&amp;rsquo;re taking the cowardly route and ultimately are creating more work for your team. Instead of solving problems, you&amp;rsquo;re creating them.
All because you&amp;rsquo;re too chicken to make a hard decision.
 Thank you, Raymond Chen! You are a legend.</description>
