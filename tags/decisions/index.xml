      <description>I think the following statement goes way deeper than it may have been intended (I might be wrong of course)&amp;hellip; Engineering is about making tradeoffs. If you refuse to make the choice, then you&amp;rsquo;re taking the cowardly route and ultimately are creating more work for your team. Instead of solving problems, you&amp;rsquo;re creating them.
All because you&amp;rsquo;re too chicken to make a hard decision.
 Thank you, Raymond Chen! You are a legend.</description>
