      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since before &lt;a href=&#34;/posts/more-punishment/&#34; title=&#34;More Punishment&#34;&gt;signing up for the marathon&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ve been making sure that I do my running training regularly. I&amp;rsquo;m currently doing at least 4 runs during the week, pushing for 5 (all during lunch times). The route that I run around the city is approximately 6.2km, which is a good distance to cover while still having time either side of the run for prepration and showering up so that I don&amp;rsquo;t offend my coworkers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
