      <description>The time has come for another meeting of the Functional Programming minds! This months BFPG Meetup, starting 6pm Monday 28th, is the first one at our new venue: Microsoft HQ, Waterfront Place, Brisbane. For details on the location, take a look at the BFPG about page.
This month we have three speakers, and I am one of them! In my talk, &amp;ldquo;Erlang - Why should you care?&amp;rdquo;, I will be giving a fairly non-technical introduction to Erlang.</description>
