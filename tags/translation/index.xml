      <description>You may remember a little while ago I wrote a post on signing assemblies that you don&amp;rsquo;t have the source code to. It got a bit of attention and was reproduced in full on dzone&amp;rsquo;s dotnet site. That was pretty exciting.
This, however, I find more exciting. This article has now been translated into Italian! This is the first time an article of mine has been reproduced in another language, which I think is just fantastic.</description>
