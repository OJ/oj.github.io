      <description>It has been a long time coming (somewhere around the 70 year mark - I think the last time was 1939) but we finally got there. Pompey made it to the FA Cup final. Not only did we get there, but we managed to beat the opposition, Cardiff, 1 - 0.
Yes, this is one of the few times I&amp;rsquo;ll ever admit to being born anywhere near Portsmouth ;) It&amp;rsquo;s good to see the lads come up with a win after a pretty good run in the Premier League in the last couple of years.</description>
