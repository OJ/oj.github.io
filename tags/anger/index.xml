To protect the innocent, I&amp;rsquo;ll refrain from naming and shaming the channel and individual as those details aren&amp;rsquo;t important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communities are arguably the life blood of technology. Without a good community the likelihood of the technology catching on is drastically reduced. Those communities which lack individuals that are happy to put time and effort in to help get others up to speed tend to stagnate. Any community which involves members that are abrasive, rude and downright offensive is destined to suffer long term.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
