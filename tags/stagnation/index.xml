You read that right. It&amp;rsquo;s OK to fail. Yes, I am talking to you. You&amp;hellip; that guy who is part of every team. The one who seems to feel the need to be right about everything. The one who thinks that everything new has already been done 15 years prior. The one who believes that every project they have participated in has been a profound success, and that a project-level failure (which includes missing deadlines or blowing the budget) is something they have never experienced. Failure is not only OK, it&amp;rsquo;s something that you &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; experience somewhere along the way so you know when you&amp;rsquo;ve succeeded.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
